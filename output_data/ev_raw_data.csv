1Introduction
While reliable, widely available, electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is essential to
expand e-mobility, smart charging technology also provides significant benefits to the power
grid, especially as the share of EVs and renewables in the market grows. For example, smart
charging technology can stabilize the grid by managing EV demand and can even increase
the uptake of renewable electricity in the grid by better managing fluctuations of solar and
wind power. EV batteries also have the potential to serve as power grid storage, enabling
greater deployment of renewable electricity and providing back-up power in case of
emergency.
The recommendations in this joint report, which are published under the EU-U.S. Trade and
Tech Working Group, respond to the current and
expected growth of the electric vehicle market and support EU and U.S. commitments to
clean energy and decarbonisation. They build on more than a decade of close, pre-normative
research cooperation between the U.S. Department of
(ANL) and the JRC), and consultations with
government, research, industry, and grid-service stakeholders1. They are intended to:
 Help accelerate the smarter use of EVs, charging infrastructure, and power grids, and
offer suggestions on how best to improve the quality, the communication protocols,
and the rapid implementation of intelligent charging infrastructure. All of these are
needed to advance the rollout of e-mobility on both sides of the Atlantic.
 Better integrate EVs into modern power distribution grids so as to enable EVs to help
manage fluctuations on the grid caused by power demand and the variability of
renewables.
 Support shared technical understanding, which will advance the development of
international standards, thereby helping to minimise trade barriers and to augment
the economies of scale for our industry.
Policy makers can help facilitate the success of Vehicle-Grid Integration at large scale,
including by setting the right frameworks for: a transatlantic Standards Support Strategy;
the systematic exchange and development of best practices, bringing more certainty to
public authorities and private investors; and joint pre-normative research that helps our
industries thrive and our communities benefit from electro-mobility.

normative-recommendations-smart-charging-and-vehicle-grid
2Summary of Recommendations
Gaps and incompatibilities in proposed connectivity and communication standards for EV
charging in the United States and the European Union may impact interoperability and drive
industry to produce for multiple requirements, leading to increased costs, prolonged
development times, and trade barriers. Transatlantic collaboration on EV infrastructure
technical requirements can help to more efficiently roll out publicly funded charging
infrastructure, harmonizing our standards where possible. This would enable our industries
to be more competitive across global markets and put us in a much stronger position in
international standardization committees to drive towards global standards that meet EU
and U.S. ambitions.
These joint EU-U.S. recommendations fall within three recommendation sets, the first of
which makes the case for a joint standards support strategy and identifies existing standards
that provide a reference for the implementation of EV charging infrastructure in the United
States and the EU. The second recommendation set elaborates on the development and
implementation of cost-effective smart charging infrastructure that avoids stranded assets
for stakeholders involved in infrastructure rollout. The third recommendation set, identifies
priorities for further joint pre-normative research in the e-mobility field.
Recommendation Set I: Develop a joint standards support strategy
Harmonized standards, codes, and regulations, along with associated test procedures, will
facilitate the growth of e-mobility and its charging eco-system and allow U.S. and EU
industries to realize economies of scale. We share manufacturers and suppliers. By
harmonizing standards, industries can cut costs and development times without hindering
innovation or their competitive edge. Moreover, extending our existing links in smart system
engineering and high-quality standard solutions would strengthen our in
what is a highly competitive world market.
We recommend jointly identifying commonalities and gaps in our standards for e-mobility
infrastructure and priorities for moving forward. Priorities should include coordinated and
more proactive involvement in Standards Development Organisations. As a basis, there is
already transatlantic agreement between the U.S. Government, European Union institutions,
and on the use of standards for public implementation specifications (IEC
61851, ISO 15118, and UN-ECE GTR EVE 22). Looking forward, we should expand activities
to boost collaboration on standards, codes, test procedures, and supporting technology
requirements.
3Recommendation Set II: Support development and implementation of cost-
effective smart charging infrastructure that avoids stranded assets
The success of broad electro-mobility uptake depends on the speedy and widely accepted
build-up of charging infrastructure. Recommendations are made on how to overcome the
growing pains and obstacles in Vehicle-Grid Integration (VGI) and Smart Charge
Management (SCM), enabling the optimization of costs and technological potential. This will
help our communities, cities, and states to develop and demonstrate VGI/SCM approaches to
reduce the grid impacts of on-road light-, medium-, and heavy-duty EV charging; to apply
policies and experience to avoid stranded assets; and to address the
charging infrastructure via coordination and shared best practices.
Recommendation Set III: Conduct pre-normative research, development and
demonstration to support the consumer, industry, and the grid
In times of evermore renewable and distributed power generation, EVs can contribute to grid
reliability by helping to avoid momentary overload outages or to control imbalances between
generation and demand. Research, development and demonstration (RD&D) and testing
methods focused on optimal application of the capabilities of EVs and their charging
infrastructure are critical to achieving consumer- and grid-friendly solutions.
A number of recommendations are provided for joint RD&D and development of common
testing procedures. This includes proposals to: conduct coordinated research to support grid
reliability under mass EV-charging; conduct common RD&D to optimize the capability of EVs
and smart chargers and their future Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
infrastructure for the provision of grid services; create cost-effective, energy-efficient, and
consumer- and grid-friendly charging solutions that integrate EVs with the grid; and support
the development of advanced charging solutions, e.g., vehicle-to-X (V2X) and Wireless Power
Transfer (WPT).
4Recommendations
I. Develop a Joint Standards Support Strategy
Transatlantic collaboration between our government research institutions currently supports
the development of standards via technical validation of proposed standards, testing
methodology optimization, technical expertise, and pre-normative research.
These joint recommendations, aimed at public authorities in the United States and the
European Union who are investing in e-mobility infrastructure, indicate where further
opportunities for collaboration exist. Policymakers can set the framework conditions for
effective, joint standardization activities to bear fruit, by motivating industry, activating their
representatives in Standards Development Organizations (SDOs), and enabling pre-
normative research.
1.) Adopt an agreed set of standards and regulations in technical requirements for
public funding, while expanding transatlantic collaboration to identify and
address priority gaps in standards for e-mobility infrastructure.
The following could be implemented now, or is currently implemented by authorities:
a) Require, as a minimum, use of pertinent IEC 61851 and IEC 62196-2/-3
standards2 for light- to medium-duty EV inlets and their EV-EVSE connectors,
- - form, as commonly used in the U.S. and
the EU, respectively.
b) Require use of at least ISO 151183 when higher level digital communication
is offered by the EV charging device in publicly funded charging infrastructure,
whatever the EV-charging power level. This will support uses such as smart
charging and secure communication.
c) Facilitate adoption of UN-ECE global technical regulation (GTR) EVE 224 to
harmonize the metrics for the state of certified energy (SOCE) in EV batteries. SOCE,
formerly referred to as SOH (or state of health), indicates the remaining certified
usable battery energy-storage capacity. UN-ECE GTR EVE 22 gives a harmonized,
reliable definition of SOCE for the use of EV batteries in electric vehicles and later,
when these batteries are dismounted for use in stationary storage systems (so-called

4 See under: https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2023-01/ECE_TRANS_180a22e.pdf
5d) Promote ongoing work at NIST and Standards Development Organizations (SDOs)
on precise, affordable, and bi-directional metering for chargers, by supporting
ANL, JRC, and EU metering device approval and calibration
authorities to partner with them on metering efforts, for a transatlantic approach, as
appropriate. Accurate metering is a pre-requisite for accurate power consumption
billing, for intelligent grid management, and to learn from the charging energy market
behavior, etc.
Looking forward:
e) Expand activities and work to achieve consensus on high-level requirements
for communications, connectivity, interoperability, cybersecurity, resilience,
safety, backward compatibility, future proofing, and metrics (e.g., support a
compatible solution for the communication between EVSE and back-end/distribution
grid).
2.) Expand activities to boost future collaboration on standards, codes, test
procedures, and supporting technology requirements.
All of the following could be implemented now:
a) Convene a forum of stakeholders to jumpstart a process to achieve a unified
vision and strategy for codes and standards, which would identify and address
competing standards to remove barriers for Smart Charge Management (SCM)
and Vehicle Grid Integration (VGI). Common pre-normative research in the field
has helped and can help this process.
b) Expand activities, motivate, and provide adequate human and financial
resources to strengthen engagement - especially in leadership roles - with
existing U.S., European, and international SDOs, to enable greater standards
harmonization for EV-Grid integration.
c) Promote further coordination and exchange of information between SDOs
and consortia of key stakeholders (e.g. Standard Setting Organizations (SSOs)
and industry associations such as CharIN, the Open Charge Alliance (OCA), EV
Roaming Foundation, etc.) to advance consolidation and convergence of technical
specifications, thus accelerating the development of a more mature and robust
electromobility market.
d) Expand common activities to support further development of standards and test
procedures for diagnostic interoperability-testing for VGI, as well as less
expensive field-testing equipment for alternating current (AC) and direct current
(DC) -charging.
6II. Support development and implementation of cost-effective smart charging
infrastructure that avoids stranded assets
Public authorities at all levels of government, including communities, cities, and states, as
well as private firms are stakeholders in the implementation of infrastructure for e-mobility.
These recommendations focus on strategies for public authorities and private firms to
successfully, and in a timely manner, develop and implement infrastructure for e-mobility.
In order for this to happen, public authorities and private firms should share lessons learned
from ongoing rollouts of infrastructure for e-mobility. Demonstration projects should reflect
real-world conditions and incorporate experiences from communities where e-mobility faces
higher barriers to uptake. Public authorities and private firms can use these
recommendations to avoid stranded assets and ensure that communication protocols are
open and accessible for future improvements.
1.) Develop and demonstrate VGI/SCM approaches to reduce grid impacts of on-
road light-, medium-, and heavy-duty EV charging.
All of the following could be implemented now:
a) Develop and demonstrate smart charging ecosystem(s) to implement SCM
strategies, . This includes
consideration of: the rules and regulations under which local and regional utilities
operate; legacy system architectures and communication protocols (e.g.,
DNP3, OpenADR, or OpenFMB); and, as appropriate, international standardization
efforts in grid automation (e.g., under IEC 618505 and IEC 623256).
b) Address additional constraints, such as the consideration of e-mobility
infrastructure deployment in underserved, environmentally sensitive communities.
Lessons should be shared from the implementation of demonstration projects in a
broad variety of communities to demonstrate specific solutions. This includes rural
areas, suburban districts, and high-density urban areas with frequent street parking
of EVs.
c) Require digital connection, smart communication capability, open access,
and local control options (i.e., non-proprietary communication) for publicly
funded charging infrastructure, to ensure that SCM programs can be implemented on
both sides of the Atlantic. Relevant information on the characteristics of the
infrastructure in support of information services should also be provided.
5 For details see: https://iec61850.dvl.iec.ch
6 For details see: https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/31487 is website
7d) Appropriately implement cybersecurity measures in the communication layers
and the memory-devices of the e-mobility charging ecosystem, including VGI and
SCM. E-mobility infrastructure cybersecurity is of high importance because of the
critical nature of charging systems to enabling operation of electric vehicles.
2.) Apply policies and experience to avoid stranded assets.
All of the following could be implemented now:
a) Avoid dependence on specific, proprietary networks for publicly funded EVSE-
installations in order to safeguard against stranded assets due to loss of network
providers for business or other reasons.
b) Require in public tenders/procurements that planning engineers and equipment
providers include in their proposals plans to upgrade charging devices and
networks communication capabilities, which will help to meet future demand
(e.g., modular design).
c) Require that new, digitally connected EV infrastructure has capabilities for over-
the-air (OTA) updates where available, to patch security gaps, add
features/upgrades, and address reliability issues.
d) Support work to identify common diagnostics and data reporting
approaches to proactively identify charging failures associated with
interoperability, communication, and other factors, which would simplify maintenance
and improve up-time of charging infrastructure.
3.) Address the charging infrastructure via coordination
and shared best practices.
All of the following could be implemented now:
a) Work with all levels of government and the private sector to develop a
systematically collected, ranked, and analyzed information database, which
would collect experiences about challenges and solutions for charging
infrastructure roll-out and planning.
b) Survey the experiences and issues faced by communities, cities, and regions
in technical as well as non-technical areas (e.g., delays from hardware availability,
building permits, grid-connection approvals, etc.). Results could then be quantitatively
ranked for severity of various types of obstacles.
8c) Disseminate experiences in planning, financing, workflow and permission
negotiations through government-supported publications and websites. This would
facilitate the introduction of VGI and smart charging infrastructure and the advent of
next level innovation such as vehicle-to- charging.
9III. Conduct pre-normative RD&D to support the consumer, industry, and the grid
Publicly funded e-mobility infrastructure can have a catalyzing effect on private industry and
private investments as well as improve the consumer experience. Greater shared
understanding of technical issues can help harmonize technical requirements and thus the
infrastructure rollout process. These recommendations identify outstanding areas which
could benefit from further joint pre-normative research.
1.) Conduct coordinated research to support grid reliability under mass EV-
charging.
The following could be implemented now:
a) Quantitatively and qualitatively identify the benefits of EVs to support grid
reliability in controlled, smart, and bidirectional charging.
b) Support U.S. and EU industry efforts to leverage EVs in an overall
Distributed Energy Resources (DER) framework by optimizing use of EVs
electric energy storage to balance intermittent production from renewables such as
solar and wind.
c) Investigate new reliability metrics with our industry to capture the impacts of
customer-provided and novel technology DER services, including those from EVs.
d) Assess innovative strategies to minimize the impacts of EV charging
infrastructure on distribution grids in dense urban, rural, and capacity
constrained areas.
Looking forward:
e) Explore simple ways of informing the charge point management system
(CPMS) about the energy needs and departure time of the driver in AC-
charging without higher level communication (HLC), which could help achieve an
effective level of grid-friendly charging. Due to cost, millions of low power charging
points will remain simple, AC-chargers of limited smartness. If there were an easy
and straightforward way to inform the CPMS of the driver's energy needs and
departure time, then an effective level of controlled, grid-friendly charging could be
achieved, thereby supporting smart charge management.
102.) Conduct coordinated RD&D on furthering and optimizing the capability of EVs
and charging infrastructure to provide grid services.
All of the following could be implemented now:
a) Evaluate the effectiveness of charge management strategies to identify which
strategies provide the most value to the grid. This is especially important in view of
future mass adoption of EVs.
b) Analyze how EVs can enable greater integration of clean DER to benefit the grid
by shifting demand (typically over hours) and addressing grid-optimized charging
strategies within load patterns over the course of the day.
c) Develop and validate the capability of cohorts of charging EVs and smart
charge hubs to reliably serve load flexibility patterns (from seconds to minutes
to longer time frames), including grid services typically implemented by utilities, e.g.,
grid stabilization/disturbance ride-through (resilience), dispatchability/flexibility, and
frequency regulation.
d) Identify communication latency requirements of devices, from the EV
throughout the charging infrastructure, and evaluate the state-of-the-art. Evaluate
round-trip response times and the frequency of control of telematic communication
pathways vis-à-vis the requirements for smart charge management and grid services
provision.
3.) Create cost-effective, energy-efficient, and consumer- and grid-friendly
charging solutions that integrate EVs with the grid.
The following could be implemented now:
a) Collaborate and exchange pre-normative research results on the electric
energy efficiency of chargers that contain power inverters, and on the stand-
by power consumption of all kinds of chargers.
b) Collect best practices of implementing smart charging infrastructure without
substantially increasing smart charging stand-by power consumption.
c) Provide technical assistance to local and regional EV adoption programs and
utilities across light-, medium-, and heavy-duty classes. Use data-mapping and -
analysis approaches for optimized EVSE density and placement. Forecast grid
impacts and assist in the development of appropriate incentives that balance
grid and customer benefits.
11d) Identify and develop best practice to disseminate information to consumers.
understanding and eventual acceptance of
smart charging in view of economic advantages and charging functionality.
e) Collect information about consumer satisfaction regarding the quality of
infrastructure, including the development of specific metrics to capture existing
challenges.
Looking forward:
f) Conduct demonstration projects to evaluate and help address regulatory, policy,
behavioral, and market barriers to enable the development of effective incentives
to use EVs to provide load flexibility for bulk power and distribution system
services.
4.) Support RD&D of advanced charging solutions, like V2X and Wireless Power
transfer.
All of the following could be implemented now:
a) Develop test procedures to support the certification of V2X-capable
products, including requirements for metrics regarding bidirectional power flow.
b) Inform product certification requirements that enable vehicle-to-grid (V2G)
interactions, while ensuring consistency with other DER. This could be done e.g.,
through collaboration with NIST, Standards Setting Organizations, pre-normative
researchers at DOE National Laboratories and the JRC, as well as with manufacturers.
c) Study the potential for V2X-capable vehicles to benefit the grid through load-
shifting in the 24-hour demand curve by leveraging their storage capability.
d) Explore the options to collect information at the identification or charge-start
stage about y for, , V2X
maneuvers.
e) Identify and evaluate critical communication latencies for V2X as per
recommendation III.2.d. on communication latency requirements.
f) Support the implementation of WPT standards and best practices, including for
more powerful WPT-systems in view of further WPT evolutions. Assure
electromagnetic compatibility of WPT through common efforts in quantifying
electromagnetic stray fields and real impacts on radio equipment, ideally in
transatlantic round-robin approaches. Regularly inform SDOs about results.

Abstract
A geospatial analysis of electric-vehicle charging infrastructure allocation within a city and a region, based on
open source GIS tools, is described. A methodology was developed to provide optimal locations of electric vehicle
infrastructure (charging stations) within a spatially extended region. Two different cases were identified:
placement in a city network (urban road network) and in a regional or national network (rural roads and
highways). For a city and a regional network, the methodology identifies high-potential areas for the installation
of charging station. In contrast, for a highway network the methodology provides explicitly the suggested
locations: the charging stations should preferably be placed in already built areas, gas stations or rest areas, to
minimize additional investment costs. A pilot study was made for the city of Bolzano/Bozen (city road network)
and the province of Alto Adige/Südtirol (rural and highway network). The municipality and the province gave
positive feedback on the suggested locations.Table of contents

2Executive summary
Policy context
Road transport, a key component of economic development and human welfare, plays a
growing role in world energy use and emissions of greenhouse gases. In 2010, globally,
the transport sector was responsible for approximately 23% of total energy-related
carbon dioxide emissions, a potent greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
from the transport sector have more than doubled since 1970, 80% of this increase
coming from road vehicles. In the European Union, road transport contributes one-fifth
of EU’s total emissions of carbon dioxide. Emissions in 2012, even though they fell by
3.3%, were still 20.5% higher than in 1990. Light-duty vehicles, cars and vans, produce
approximately 15% of the EU’s emissions of carbon dioxide.
Transport in Europe is 94 % dependent on oil, 84 % of it imported, leading to a financial
cost of EUR 1 billion per day and significant dependence on importing oil with the
consequent threat to the EU’s security of energy supply.
Emissions from road transport influence air quality in cities. Numerous epidemiological
and toxicological studies have associated urban air quality and air pollution, including
particulate matter, with adverse health effects.
Given the negative impact of fossil fuels on the environment, public health, and energy
security policy makers support the replacement of fossil fuels by more sustainable
alternatives.
The European Commission regards alternative fuels an important option to sustainable
mobility in Europe. The Clean Power for Transport package, adopted in 2013, aims to
foster the development of a single market for alternative fuels for transport in Europe. It
contains a Communication laying out a comprehensive European alternative fuels
strategy [COM(2013)17] for the long-term substitution of oil as an energy source in all
modes of transport. The Directive on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure
(2014/94/EU) requires Member States to develop national policy frameworks for the
market development of alternative fuels and their infrastructure, among other elements.
The study summarized in this report presents a GIS (Geographic Information System)
methodology, based on open source tools that may assist national authorities to allocate
charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs) in urban environments, rural road networks,
and highways.
Key conclusions
The aim of the proposed methodology is to provide optimal locations of EV infrastructure
(charging stations) within a spatially extended region. Two different cases were
identified: placement in a city network (urban road network) and placement in a regional
or national network (rural roads and highways). For a city and a regional network, the
methodology identifies high-potential areas for the installation of charging stations. In
contrast, for a highway network the methodology provides explicitly the suggested
locations: the charging stations should preferably be placed in already built areas, gas
stations or rest areas, to minimize additional investment costs.
3A pilot study was made for the city of Bolzano/Bozen (city road network) and the
province of Alto Adige/Südtirol (rural and highway network). The results of the study
were highly appreciated by the municipality and the province.
Main findings
Particular characteristics of the methodology are its versatility and ease of use. The
methodology can be easily implemented by local or regional authorities as it relies
mainly on data readily available to them.
As in many previous studies, the critical issue is data availability. Local authorities and
network operators have to assist in the collection of required data that are difficult to
find from other sources. Typical information required is residential data, parking places,
electricity network, and already installed charging points.
The methodology described in the report can also be used to support the implementation
of the Directive on the Deployment of Alternative Fuels Infrastructure, thereby assisting
Member States to enhance deployment of EVs and their recharge infrastructure.
Regarding the analysis of the highway network, the methodology could provide
additional input in studies that analyze the inter-connection of highway corridors across
member states throughout Europe.
Related and future JRC work
A future development could be the application of the methodology to other cities to
investigate the effect of different layers or weighting factors on the allocation map.
Examples could be cities of different sizes (spatial extent and population), located in
different countries (Gross Domestic Product, transport demand and options, climate
conditions).
41. Introduction
Emissions from the road transport sector are responsible for most of the air quality
problems in cities across the European Union (see, for example, Ntziachristos et al.,
2009). The European Commission vigorously supports sustainable-mobility initiatives
and smart-cities projects that can lead to road-transport decarbonisation or
mitigation of urban air pollution. They are among the pillars of the Europe 2020
strategy (EC, 2015a). One of the key aspects of these initiatives is the
decarbonisation of road transport with the further deployment of electric vehicles
(EVs) across Europe (EC, 2015b). Whereas financial incentives are a basic factor for
EV deployment in the EU member states, the other important issue is the existence
of an appropriate, publicly accessible charging infrastructure (Thiel et al., 2015).
The objective of this report is to provide a methodology to determine the optimal
areas to allocate EV charging infrastructure at a city or regional and national level.
Two different, but complementary, approaches are proposed depending on the
spatial scale of the area of study. The first approach is appropriate at city level, and
the second at regional or national level. Various previous studies have addressed the
issue of allocation of EV infrastructure. Some studies take into consideration driving
patterns of conventional vehicles (De Gennaro et al., 2014, 2015; Paffumi et al.,
2014), others origin-destination matrixes (Bauche et al, 2014, Efthymiou et al.,
2015), or flow refueling optimization (Cruz-Zambrano et al., 2013; Kuby et al.,
2009). Some analyses are based on proprietary commercial GIS software, e.g.,
ArcGIS (Lindblad, 2012). The methodology described in this document is based on
the hypothesis that EV drivers in urban areas will be an integral part of a smart city
and their re-charging needs can be accommodated within a smart urban planning
approach. Hence, the methodology tries to solve the problem of optimal allocation of
the recharging infrastructure within an urban planning approach. As such, it is based
on geospatial data that can be provided by local or national authorities or obtained
from online sources like OpenStreetMap (OSM, 2015). Furthermore, it can be
applied using open source GIS tools like QGIS (QGIS, 2015). In fact, all the maps
presented herein were created with open source GIS tools. The maps were overlaid
on Google Streets or Google Satellite layers using the Openlayers plugin of QGIS,
but any similar layer-software may be used (OpenStreetMap, Bing Maps, etc.).
Various electro-mobility projects in Europe were studied to develop the proposed
methodology. The Green eMotion (Corchero et al., 2015) and Zem2All (Zem2All,
2015) projects were analyzed, along with proposed or implemented action plans on
EV charging infrastructure deployment in cities and regions around the world (TfL,
2010; AUE, 2012; C2ES 2012; Forbes et al., 2012; TS, 2013). The feedback of
relevant stakeholders expressed in various electro-mobility forums was taken into
consideration (MoTraSim, 2014; UITP, 2015; POLIS, 2015). The methodology also
considers the requirements incorporated in the Directive on the Deployment of
Alternative Fuels Infrastructure (EU, 2014): thus, it can guide member states in
their elaboration of national policy frameworks as required by the Directive.
The city level approach was successfully applied to the city of Bolzano/Bozen (Italy)
and the regional (or national) level approach to the province of Alto Adige/Südtirol
(Italy).1 These studies were performed in collaboration with the European Academy
of Bozen/Bolzano (EURAC). The steps of the implementation along with the resulting
allocation maps are presented and commented upon.
1Henceforth, for compactness we shall refer to the city and region as Bolzano and Alto
Adige, respectively.
52. City level
The approach at city level is based on a set of collected geospatial data that are edited
to be transformed into raster layers. Based on different weighting factors and using map
algebra a map is created with cells of size 100x100 m (Figure 1). This calculated map
indicates the optimal city areas where EV charging infrastructure (i.e., charging stations)
could be placed according to specific scoring levels (which, of course, depend on the
weighting factors). Local authorities along with the electricity distribution system
operator (DSO) can agree on the exact location of the charging stations within the high-
score areas. The final location should take into account space limitations and the
maximum acceptable distance from the electricity network. Space limitations could also
include the width and installations present in road pavements. For example, in the city of
Oslo, space limitations were imposed by the municipality pavement cleaning service, and
by citizen complaints about the bright light emitted by some chargers placed close to the
windows of their ground-floor apartments (AUE, 2012). The analysis at city level is
based on an urban planning spatial analysis approach similar to the process used to
define the optimal areas to allocate land for waste incineration (CUOSG, 2015a) or
emergency shelters (CUOSG, 2015b).
In this section, the required input data are presented along with the methodology. The
developed methodology is applied to the city of Bolzano in the last subsection. The
required input data may vary depending on the scope of the study and the examined
area: for example, layers could be added or removed according to the needs of the
study.
Figure 1. Land allocation map obtained via map algebra and weighting factors on raster
layers.
62.1 Input data
2.1.1 Residential statistics
Residential statistics refer to statistical data on the number of people (and possibly their
characteristics such as age, employment status, etc.) who live within the examined area.
These data are used to locate public charging stations that are within close proximity to
highly populated areas. The aim is to provide charging stations to be used mostly at
night by drivers who do not have access to private plugs (as those in private garages).
The residential statistics data can also be expressed as population density maps. They
should be collected at as high spatial resolution as possible.
Suggested format:
Polygon shapefile (ESRI format) or raster file (TIF format).
Possible source:
 Local authorities (Municipality, Province, Region),
 National or governmental agencies (National Statistical Service, National Land
Survey and Registry).
2.1.2 Parking areas
This category of data includes:
 suitable parking areas alongside roads,
 garages,
 Open parking areas.
Most possibly, they can be found on urban-planning or land-use maps. Parking operators
could also provide data on their parking area (Figure 2). It would be very useful if the
data included information on the capacity of the parking area (e.g., maximum number of
vehicles).
Suggested format:
Polygon (or point, if not available) shapefile (ESRI format).
Possible source:
 Local authorities (Municipality, Province, Region),
 National or governmental agencies (National Transport Agency, National Land
Survey and Registry),
 Parking companies.
Figure 2. Parking areas.
72.1.3 Electic power distribution network
These data are used to map the electric power grid to which charging stations would
connect. The aim is to minimize investment by using the available grid coverage. The
data are usually available from the DSO. A detailed data file (with the capacity and
characteristics of the grid segments) will render easier the identification of the capacity
limits of each area. Various electricity networks are shown in Figure 3. For this study,
only the city and rural networks are needed.
Suggested format:
Polyline shapefile (ESRI format).
Possible source:
 Electricity distribution companies (DSO),
 Local authorities (Municipality, Province, Region),
 National or governmental agencies.
Figure 3. Schematic representation of electricity networks (MBizon, 2010).
82.1.4 Public transport stations
Following the Directive on the Deployment of Alternative Fuels Infrastructure (EU, 2014),
and to support co-modality in transport, the installation of charging stations close to
public transport stations is recommended. The public transport stations include airports,
ports, train, and bus stations.
Suggested format:
Polyline or point shapefile (ESRI format).
Possible source:
 Local authorities (Municipality, Province, Region),
 National or governmental agencies,
 OpenStreetMaps.
2.1.5 Public access building
They refer to buildings accessible to the public such as hospitals, museums, theatres,
and universities.
Suggested format:
Polyline or point shapefile (ESRI format).
Possible source:
 Local authorities (Municipality, Province, Region),
 National or governmental agencies,
 OpenStreetMaps.
2.1.6 Shopping and food areas
They refer to places like single shops and stores, malls, restaurants, and bars in the city.
Suggested format:
Polyline or point shapefile (ESRI format).
Possible source:
 Local authorities (Municipality, Province, Region),
 National or governmental agencies ,
 Online sources (OpenStreetMaps, Foursquare etc.).
92.2 Methodology
After collecting the necessary geospatial data, a number of steps follow:
2.2.1 Creation of the base vector grid
Use the layer with the largest spatial extent to create a vector grid2 of 100x100m with a GIS tool.
This grid becomes the base to spatially join all other layers (i.e., to create a join between two sets of
geospatial data), and to create the relevant vector grid layers. Figure 4 presents the creation of the
vector grid from the residential statistics polygon layer of Bolzano: the software QGIS and the
""Vector Grid"" form were used.
Figure 4. Creation of the base vector grid.
2.2.2 Bufering
Create buffer zones for the other input layers. The buffer zones indicate an effective area around
either a point of interest (POI) or a network. The buffering process requires that a characteristic
length be chosen: this choice depends on the needs of the study. We chose the maximum distance
between the electricity network and a charging station to be approximately 50m, since at larger
distances the connection to the grid may be difficult, or expensive, or it might require additional
installation time. Figure 5 presents this buffering using the 'Create Buffers' form of the MMQGIS
plug-in of QGIS.
Figure 5. Creation of the buffer.
2 The vector grid is similar to a raster layer, but it contains vector information. We use a
vector grid to perform operations on vector data layers. In the end, we rasterize them to
apply the weighting factors on them.
10For POI a 100m is suggested as explained in Section 2.2.3: the choice is related to the spatial join of
the vector grid. An example of buffering of a point layer that includes public access buildings
(theatres, museums, cinemas, and sightseeing) is presented in Figure 6. An example of buffering of a
polygon layer of public transport stations (airport, train and bus stations) is presented in Figure 7.
Figure 6. Buffering of a point layer (theatres, museums, cinemas and sightseeing).
Figure 7. Buffering of a polygon layer (public transport stations).
2.2.3 Spatial join of buffered layers with the vector grid
Initially, the residential statistics polygon layer is spatially joined with the vector grid to create the
population density map. The proportional sum of the polygons is added to the grid cells (Figure 8).
11Then, all the buffered layers are spatially joined with the vector grid. In this way, all layers are
converted into vector grid layers with the same format and extension. For the electricity network, if
the buffered layer intersects cells of the grid the cell is assigned a value of 1, otherwise it is assigned
a 0. The results obtained using the 'Spatial Join' form of the MMQGIS plugin are presented in Figure
9.
For the rest of the layers the number of features intersecting a cell are counted, and the number is
added to the value of the cell. The same plugin, as used for the electricity network, is used. The
result of spatially joining the layer for the theatres, museums, cinemas, and sightseeing layer with
the vector grid is presented in Figure 10. Only for the public transport stations the separate features
are not summed-up, but the cells that intersect them take a value equal with 1. This choice is made
because all public transport stations should have the same importance irrespective of their
proximity. The result of the spatial join with the rest of the layers is presented in Figure 11.

.

12Figure 10. Spatial join of the theatres, museums, cinemas and sightseeing layer with the
vector grid.
Figure 11. Spatial join of the public transport stations layer with the vector grid.
Further examples of spatially joining buffered layers (parking space, health centres, university
locations, stores, restaurants, and malls) with the vector grid are presented in Appendix I.
We conclude by justifying our choice of a 100m buffering of POI, as used in Section 2.2.2. We
consider that an acceptable walking distance between a charging station and POI should be less than
300m. Simple geometric considerations (see Figure 12) show that a 100m radius of buffering
coupled to a spatial join with 100x100m cells leads to a maximum Euclidean distance between the
centre of the POI and the furthest corner of an intersecting cell smaller than 300m.
Figure 12. Maximum distance between the centre of the POI and the furthest corner of
an intersecting cell.
132.2.4 Scaling and rastering
The outcome of the previous step is a group of vector grid layers with cells to which maximum and
minimum values have been assigned or calculated. First a scaling is applied and the results are
presented in an additional column (appropriately called 'SCORE') that is added in the feature
database. Equation 1 is applied on each cell of all layers.
Equation 1
SCORE(i) =value (i) * 10 / max
where:
i = number of cell
value(i) = the value of the ith cell
max = the maximum value of all cells of the layer
The scaling is applied to normalize cell scores between 0 and 10. Lastly, all layers are rasterized
based on the 'SCORE' column values.
2.2.5 Map algebra on raster layers
The result of the previous step is a group of raster layers. At this point a weighting factor is applied
on each layer based on its importance or usability. Equation 2 can, then, be used with the 'Raster
calculator' of QGIS to create a land allocation map with each cell having a different score (Figure 1).
Equation 2
Raster_electricity_network * (Raster_file * Factor + Raster_file * Factor …)
1 1 2 2
It is important to note that Equation (2) places emphasis on the electricity network, in
that it provides an overall multiplication factor3. This choice reflects the importance of
the existing electricity grid lay-out, and our assumption that no significant modification
of the power grid lay-out should be required in planning the allocation of charging
stations in a city.
3 As explained in Section 2.2.3 we chose the Raster_electricity_network to be a binary
variable [0,1], making the presence of power lines a necessary condition for the
consideration of the respective grid cell. Obviously, users of the methodology could
deviate from this choice depending on how much emphasis they want to place on the
presence of power lines.
142.3 Test case: City of Bolzano
The municipality of Bolzano and the electricity DSO Alperia Srl (the company formed by the merger
of SEL and AEW that became operational in January 2016 in Alto Adige) gathered and provided us
(through EURAC) the required input data to apply the proposed methodology to the city of Bolzano.
Various weighting factors (as described in Section 2.2.5) were tested: the final set of factors is
presented in Figure 13. These factors are also based on the number of visitors expected in the
various locations. It is apparent that the weighting factors can be changed according to the needs of
the study, or if additional information is obtained. For example, if residential areas are considered of
higher importance than shopping areas, then the population density weight should increase and the
shopping/food areas weight should decrease accordingly.
Figure 13. Weighting factors of all raster layers.
The allocation map based on the factors summarized in Figure 13 is presented in Figure 14. The
same map overlaid on a satellite view can be seen on Figure 15. The cells are coloured according to
the following colour code:
 Red: areas with high score,
 : areas with medium score,
 Blue: areas with low score.
Normal chargers can be placed on the Red and Yellow areas, whereas fast chargers can be placed at:
 gas stations,
 public transport stations, and
 parking places that allow limited-time parking (they usually are close to the city centre and
pedestrian zones) included inside the Red areas.
In Figures 14 and 15, the red zones are parking areas near the train and bus stations,
airport, university, exhibition centre, shopping mall, hospital, and cemetery. The large
yellow zones with smaller red areas coincide with parking areas in densely populated
districts, as well as near the city centre with its many shops and the pedestrian zone.
The ""empty"" cells are either outside city limits or without power lines.

satellite view (legend: score/cell).
163. Regional/national level
In this section, the required input data along with the analysis of the optimal allocation
of charging infrastructure in the province of Alto Adige (Italy) are presented. The spatial
extent of the studied area was based on the road network provided to the JRC by EURAC
(Figure 16). The study was divided into two parts. The first focused on the highway
(referred to as ""autostrada"") and the second on the main rural roads (referred to as
""provinciale"" and ""statale""). QGIS was used for the analysis along with the QChainage
and MMQGIS open source plugins.

Map content and navigation companies (Google Places API, HERE maps API, Bing Maps
API etc.).
3.2 Methodology
The regional/national level analysis aims to allocate EV infrastructure every x km, where
x should be large enough to ensure that no electric vehicle remain without adequate
charge on the road (not complete discharge of the usable battery energy). First, the
highway network is studied based on the geospatial polyline shapefile with the set of
available gas stations and rest areas (as a geospatial point shapefile) along the highway.
The suitable and optimal stations or rest areas are selected based on an algorithm that
compares all network distances between them. For the rest of the regional network, the
geospatial shapefile of the main rural roads is used. It is split in a way that the algorithm
predicts an adequate infrastructure for an EV to travel throughout the region without
running out battery energy.
3.2.1 Highway network
Charging stations on highways have to be placed in already built areas (rest areas, gas
stations, etc.) since the cost and time to construct new areas is high. According to a JRC
mobility data analysis, based on both conventional and electric vehicles from various
regions (Donati et al., 2015), charging stations placed at a maximum distance of
approximately 60km (actual road distance and not Euclidean distance) would provide an
adequate infrastructure. We note that a highway charging station serves vehicles
travelling towards a specific highway direction since rest and service areas cannot be
accessed from both directions. Hence, the distance of 60km refers to each highway
direction, the two directions being independent.
3.2.2 Rural-road network
The analysis of the network of rural roads requires a different approach since each
suggested charging point location can serve both road directions. In addition, even
though the complete road network across the province has to be covered the
infrastructure should be placed along the main roads. The charging infrastructure can be
installed at either already existing gas stations or public parking areas, or it can be
assigned close to the main roads.
183.3 Test case: Province of Alto Adige
3.3.1 Highway network
Create a geospatial file (shapefile) with the highway network in the province. It should
include the highway direction: for the case of Alto Adige, the two directions are North
and South. Figure 17 presents this shapefile overlaid on Google street maps with a
zoomed-in area indicating the two different directions. The process of overlaying
required a set of dissolving (i.e., connecting adjacent lines) and splitting (i.e., breaking
lines into segments) steps of the initial polyline shapefile4.
Figure 17. The highway network. Both directions (North, South) are indicated.
The second step is the creation of a shapefile with the location of the gas stations along
the highway5. Only the gas stations that belong to the highway's rest areas were
selected and not those that would require to exit the highway. Figure 18 presents these
gas stations: there are four in the direction North and four in the direction South. They
are assigned numbers in ascending order according to the highway direction.
Each highway direction has to be split according to the location of the gas stations. The
suitable splitting points were determined using the perpendicular of the points to the
corresponding polylines. Then, the length of the resulting segments was calculated.
Figure 19 presents the distances between the beginning of the highway (chosen to be
the border with another province in the South and with another country-Austria-in the
4 Highway data source: OpenStreetMaps https://www.openstreetmap.org
5 Gas stations data source: Experian Ltd. 2012
19North) and the first gas station, between consecutive gas stations, and between the last
gas station and the end of the highway.
The algorithm used to decide which of these stations is appropriate for the installation of
charging infrastructure checks first whether the distances between the gas stations are
less than 60km (including the distances between the beginning and the end of the
highway). Based on these distances, the algorithm determines whether new service
areas should be built to host the charging infrastructure. For the case of Alto Adige this
is not necessary.
Figure 18. Gas stations located along the highway.
After this step, the algorithm must satisfy an additional condition. Charging
infrastructure has to be installed at the first and the last gas stations (within the region),
since it is unknown how far (if at all) charging stations are located before and after the
examined area. This condition has to be applied to all regions in Europe that plan to
install charging infrastructure on highways if the location of the charging stations in
neighbouring provinces or states is unknown. The condition guarantees safe and
seamless transport of electric vehicles in confining regions and countries. Accordingly,
""North #1"", North #4"", ""South #1"", and ""South #4"" are selected suggested areas.
The algorithm continues by checking the distance between consecutive gas stations. An
area is characterized as ""suggested"" every time the limit of 60km from the last
""suggested"" area is exceeded. For the case of Alto Adige it is considerably simple since
there are only two unassigned gas stations per direction. If we consider the direction
North the optimal allocation would be ""North #2"" instead of ""North #3"" because a
smaller travelling distance is calculated . In more detail:
 Choosing ""North #2"" implies a maximum distance of 44km between charging stations6.
6 The total distance between North #2 and #4
20 Choosing ""North #3"" implies a maximum distance of 54km between charging stations7.
The same approach for direction South suggests that the optimal allocation would be
""South #3"":
 Choosing ""South #2"" implies a maximum distance of 57km between charging stations8.
 Choosing ""South #3"" implies a maximum distance of 49km between charging stations9.
Figure 19. Distances between gas stations and the beginning/end of the highway.
The list of suggested gas stations based on the above algorithm is presented in Table 1.
The total calculated number is three gas stations towards the North and three towards
the South. Figure 20 presents these gas stations geospatially and Figure 21 presents
them zoomed-in and overlaid on Google Street maps.

223.3.2 Rural network
The road network provided by EURAC (Figure 16) does not distinguish between main or
secondary roads. We decided to keep only the roads that were categorized as
""provinciale"" (managed by the province) and ""statale"" (managed by the state).
Highways had been removed from the shapefile. All the segments that are smaller than
20 km were removed, and the connected roads were dissolved. The resulting network is
presented in Figure 22.
Figure 22. Main roads except highways and road segments less than 20km.
The next step demands the assignment of charging stations on the road network every
30 km. A maximum range of 30 km (half the 60 km used in the highway calculation)
was chosen for rural roads since the analysis was based solely on main roads, but the
resulting infrastructure should cover also the smaller roads (<20 km). Furthermore, the
charging stations would serve both directions: for example, the last charging station
before the end of a road should also cover the distance to return to the charging station.
The assignment of charging stations could be made with the QChainage10 plugin.
However, the plugin could not be used directly on the whole network because not all
road segments are connected. Therefore, first consecutive road segments were grouped
based on their direction and taking the city of Bolzano, the capital of the province, as the
centre. This step resulted in four groups: roads heading West, East, North, and South
(Figure 23).
10 https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qchainage/
23The plugin QChainage was then applied separately for each group splitting the road
network every 30 km. The splitting points are presented in Figure 24 by stars. The
location of the symbols indicates a suggested location to install a charging station. The
stations may be placed in either parking areas and/or gas stations along the roads or in
a new area (the choice may be guided by the minimum expenditure). The position has to
be decided within a +/- 10km buffer region from the suggested areas. This buffer
should be the actual road distance and not the Euclidean distance. Some suggested
areas may seem close to each other, but they serve different road segments (Figure 25).
The maximum distance of 30 km along with the maximum buffer of 20km add up to a
maximum distance of 50km between stations, an acceptable distance, as argued.
According to our calculations, the total number of suggested locations to place charging
stations on the rural road network (“Strada provinciale” and “statale” , but not highway,
“Autostrada”) for the Alto Adige province is 36.

254. Summary
A geospatial analysis of electric-vehicle charging infrastructure allocation within a city
and a region, based on open source GIS tools, is described. A methodology was
developed to provide optimal locations of EV infrastructure (charging stations) within a
spatially extended region. Two different cases were identified: placement in a city
network (urban road network) and placement in a regional or national network (rural
roads and highways). For a city and a regional network, the methodology identifies high-
potential areas for the installation of charging station. In contrast, for a highway network
the methodology provides explicitly the suggested locations: the charging stations
should preferably be placed in already built areas, gas stations or rest areas, to minimize
additional investment costs. A pilot study was made for the city of Bolzano/Bozen (city
road network) and the province of Alto Adige/Südtirol (rural and highway network). The
municipality and the province gave positive feedback on the suggested locations.
Particular characteristics of the methodology are its versatility and ease of use. For the
city-level analysis, the final raster map can be easily combined with other raster layers
to refine the optimal locations. Additional raster layers may be obtained, for example,
from other studies or they may arise from specific requirements. If a raster layer
specifying areas where it is prohibited to install charging stations, or a layer with areas
that are mandatory for installation, is available a new allocation map can be created with
little additional effort. The methodology can be easily implemented by local or regional
authorities as it relies mainly on data readily available to them.
A further development of our study could be the application of the methodology to other
cities so that the effect of different layers or weighting factors on the final allocation map
can be investigated. Some examples of areas that could be examined are cities of
different sizes (both in spatial extent and population), located in different countries
(different Gross Domestic Product, transport demand and options, climate conditions).
The approach could be supplemented by including information on existing charging
stations and their usage.
Similar to most studies the critical issue is data availability. Local authorities and
network operators have to assist in the collection of required data that are difficult to
find from other sources like residential data, parking places, electricity network, and
already installed charging points.
The methodology described in the report can also be used to support the implementation
of the Directive on the Deployment of Alternative Fuels Infrastructure (EU, 2014),
thereby assisting member states to enhance deployment of EVs and their recharge
infrastructure. Regarding the analysis of the highway network, the methodology could
provide additional input in studies that analyze the inter-connection of highway corridors
across member states throughout Europe.

Introduction
Background
The European Union’s ambitious climate objectives rely on a widespread and rapid transition from
internal combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs) over the next few years. For this to happen,
significant investment is needed to create a comprehensive, reliable and competitive EV charging
network: the European Commission’s Green Deal estimates that the number of publicly accessible
charging points must increase from 200 000 in 2020 to at least 1 million in 2025.
Shaped by the pattern and pace of EV uptake and the maturity of EV charging businesses, the solutions
to this investment challenge will be numerous and varied across the European Union. Some will be
purely market-driven while others will need to be encouraged, supported or led by the public sector,
primarily through:
• policy — such as planning policy that enables EV charging infrastructure in public places, or tax
breaks or other incentives that encourage EV uptake;
• funding — including grants or loans made available to EV charging businesses;
• partnering — working with private partners to secure the delivery of public EV charging
infrastructure and/or services.
A partnering approach will be appropriate for public authorities preferring more control and certainty
on the scope and timing of public EV charging infrastructure deployment than the market can or will
deliver by itself (or with enabling policy and funding support). This applies to many public authorities
faced with demanding climate policy objectives and targets.

INTRODUCTION4
About this guide
A public authority wishing to pursue a partnering approach has various partnering models from
which to choose. These include public contract, joint venture, concession, availability-based contract
and licence.1
This guide focuses specifically on the concession model. Its aim is not to recommend this model above
other partnering models, but to address a perceived need for greater understanding of concessions
among public authorities (particularly at the local and municipal levels, where responsibility for EV
rollout typically lies). Some public authorities are already successfully using concession contracts for
this purpose,2 but experience or know-how in this area is otherwise quite limited.
This guide therefore seeks to increase general awareness and understanding of the use, structure
and content of concession contracts for public EV charging infrastructure. It draws on the European
PPP Expertise Centre’s experience and knowledge of best practice on concessions and other forms of
public-private partnership (PPP).
This guide is structured as follows:
• Part 1 sets the scene for deciding to use the concession model to procure public EV charging
infrastructure. It describes how the concession model aligns with public authorities’ typical objectives for
this infrastructure, and compares the concession model against other partnering models in this regard.
• Part 2 is the main body of the guide. Organised around the main themes to cover in a concession
contract for public EV charging infrastructure, it explores the risks and issues associated with each
theme and explains how to approach these in structuring and drafting the concession contract.
1 These five models are identified in the Sustainable Transport Forum’s Recommendations adopted in December 2020 (see: https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-
themes/clean-transport-urban-transport/sustainable-transport-forum-stf/active-sub-groups/sub-group-best-practices-public-authorities-support-deployment-
recharging-infrastructure_en)
2 Examples include the authorities in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht in the Netherlands.

Users must note the following limitations of this guide:
• It applies to publicly accessible EV charging infrastructure for use by private vehicles. It does not
cover EV charging infrastructure for public transport, charging at home or work schemes for fleets
or private vehicles, or private-to-private contracts. It applies only to charging for battery-powered
EVs, and not to other zero-emission mobility solutions such as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.
• It does not purport to recommend the adoption of a partnering approach alongside or instead of
other forms of intervention in the EV charging market (such as policy or funding). That is a decision
for the public authority to make, based on its particular objectives and constraints.
• As already stated, this guide does not purport to recommend a concession model over other
partnering models. While Part 1 suggests and analyses the factors that might influence a public
authority’s choice of model, this is only to provide useful context for the rest of the guide.
This guide does not list exhaustively or analyse in depth the issues that a public authority must
consider in making this choice. Therefore, it must not be interpreted as endorsing or advising on a
public authority’s choice of partnering model.
• This guide does not cover either the process a public authority must follow or the decisions it must
make in determining the strategy or scope of an EV charging infrastructure concession contract.4
• Part 2 does not provide an exhaustive list of concession contract clauses, nor the depth of analysis
needed to develop and write a concession contract. Neither does this guide claim to cover all the
ways a concession contract might address individual risks or issues. The individual circumstances
of each EV charging infrastructure procurement, including the underlying laws, regulations and
policies, will determine the most appropriate allocation of risks and the wording needed to reflect
that risk allocation in the concession contract.
• This guide is not intended to replicate or substitute for professional advisory services (such as legal,
financial or technical services) that a public authority may need in preparing and procuring EV
infrastructure.
3 A typical project cycle is described in the EPEC Guide to PPP: https://www.eib.org/en/readonline-publications/epec-ppp-guide-project-cycle.
4 For example a local authority may need to consider the following questions: What market segment does it want to address (town centre, rural, slow charging, fast
charging)? Are electricity grid upgrades and connections required? Will the private partner be required to deliver a specific number of EV charging points and/or to
install EV charging points in response to data or actual demand? The Sustainable Transport Forum’s Recommendations, adopted in December 2020, provide further
information on these and various other points.

Deciding to use a concession model
Overview of the partnering models
A concession is just one partnering model available for procuring public EV charging infrastructure.
The four other main models are public contract, joint venture, availability-based contract, and licence.5
Each model differs in the form of support required from the public authority and the allocation of
responsibilities and risks between it and the private partner.
These models are described in very simple terms below, followed by an illustration of how they
typically allocate the main project risks and responsibilities in a partnering approach to the rollout and
management of EV charging infrastructure. Note that individual markets and legal systems might use
different names for the models described below. In addition, there is scope for variation and flexibility
within each model, and hybrid models can be formed by combining elements of more than one model.
Five main partnering models
Public contract The public authority controls the specification, installation, operation and use of
the infrastructure. It retains most of the project risks from installation through
to exploitation (including user-demand risk), contracting these out as required.
The public authority finances the capital, operation and maintenance expenditure,
and collects and retains revenues from users.
Joint venture The public authority and private partner share control of the infrastructure
through a joint venture company they create. The risks are shared by the
parties according to their stakes in the joint venture. The model is flexible on
arrangements for financing, which might come from one or both parties or from
a separate third party. User revenues are also collected and shared by the parties
according to their stakes.
Concession The public authority retains some control over the specification, installation,
operation and use of the infrastructure. The risks associated with installation
through to exploitation (including user-demand risk) are typically transferred to
the private partner, although risk allocation in the concession contract can be
tailored to the specific circumstances. The private partner finances the capital
and maintenance expenditure, with or without subsidies, guarantees or other
financial support from the public authority. It also collects and retains user
revenues, with or without sharing with the public authority.
Availability- The public authority retains some control over the infrastructure, as in the
based contract concession model. Risks associated with installation through to exploitation are
mainly transferred to the private partner, with the notable exception of user-
demand risk. The private partner finances the expenditure, with or without
financial support from the public authority, and is paid by the public authority
over the duration of the contract only if the infrastructure is continually available
for its intended use.
Licence The private partner controls the infrastructure and retains most of the project
risks from installation through to exploitation. It finances the capital and
maintenance expenditure, and collects and retains user revenues. A licence
might include conditions and limitations regarding the private partner’s actions,
but typically allows more freedom than other partnering models (stating what
the private partner may, rather than must, do).

ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING CONCESSIONS: A CONTRACT GUIDE FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES11
Analysing the partnering models against
the public authority’s objectives
The public authority should design its partnering intervention in line with its main objectives for the EV
charging infrastructure rollout. Each model addresses those objectives in different ways and different
analyses are needed to define the terms of the model (such as technical input specifications in a public
contract vs. output specifications in a concession contract). Common public authority objectives include
the following:
1. Roll out a number of EV charging points within a specific timeframe.
2. Establish a reliable functioning network of EV charging points with sufficient capacity to meet
user demand.
3. Achieve high levels of user satisfaction with public EV charging services.
4. Reach areas with low user demand (current and/or projected).
5. Create and/or maintain a competitive market for EV charging that drives fair prices for users.
6. Integrate EV charging within a wider eco-mobility strategy.
7. Use private sector capital and minimise the impact on public finances.
8. Deploy private sector expertise and resources.
Each of these objectives is discussed below.
O bjective 1
Roll out a specific number of EV charging points within a specific timeframe
A public authority’s decision to intervene in the EV charging infrastructure market is typically driven by
local, regional or national policy targets on the number of publicly accessible EV charging points.6
Those targets can be readily transposed into obligations on the private partner to install [x] charging
points by [date] under a public contract, concession contract or availability-based contract.7
In the public contract model, a payment schedule linked to installation milestones, with financial
penalties for delay, incentivises the private partner to deliver. Where the private partner finances
the investment upfront and is repaid gradually over time, through user revenues in the concession
model or public authority payments in the availability-based model, the incentive to meet timescale,
specification and cost requirements is even stronger.
By contrast, the more cooperative nature of the joint venture model and greater freedom afforded by
the licence model give the public authority less control over how many and how quickly EV charging
points are deployed. These approaches rely more on the market’s appetite and initiative to invest in
areas with clear user demand.
6 The revision of the EU Directive on Alternative Fuel Infrastructure requires Member States to develop national targets that will result in a minimum of 1 kW power
output through publicly accessible charging points for every EV.
7 This approach might be particularly relevant where the public authority’s strategy is to create demand for EVs by establishing a visible and reliable public EV charging
network. A contrasting approach is to respond to demand for EV charging infrastructure by installing on the basis of projected (data-driven) or actual (user-driven)
demand. A hybrid approach might also be used, requiring the private partner to install a specific number of charging points and thereafter respond to projected or
actual demand.
PART 1: DECIDING TO USE A CONCESSION MODEL12
Objective 2
Establish a reliable and functioning network of EV charging points with sufficient capacity to meet
user demand
In the public contract model, having paid for the installation of the infrastructure, the public authority
then bears risk and responsibility for its ongoing reliability and functionality. The public authority
has some recourse against the manufacturer and/or installer for defects, and might outsource some
maintenance and operational services to the same (or more likely another) private partner, but needs
to manage the placement of and any interfaces between those contracts. This requires the public
authority to possess or hire technical expertise with respect to the charging networks. Ultimately,
an unreliable, poorly functioning network could lead to lower-than-expected user revenues and a
reduced funding stream to cover the authority’s upfront investment and ongoing operating and
maintenance costs.
By contrast, the concession and availability-based models adopt an integrated approach by
transferring the risk of maintaining a reliable, functioning network to the private partner that provides
and installs the infrastructure. This also removes any need for interface management by the public
authority. If the network is unavailable for use, the private partner loses revenues (user revenues under
the concession model; availability payments from the public authority under the availability-based
model). This loss of revenues in turn affects the private partner’s return on its upfront investment.
Therefore, the concession and availability-based models create a strong financial incentive for the
private partner to ensure the charging points remain available for use. In addition, both models use a
system of key performance indicators to measure the network’s condition and functionality over the
life of the contract, with financial penalties applied by the public authority for non-compliance.
The concession model further incentivises the private partner to optimise the use of charging points
to meet user demand: more use generates more revenues. This natural incentive is missing in the
pure availability-based model (where the risk/reward of user demand lies with the public authority)
but could be replicated to some extent, for instance through a mechanism where the public authority
shares any revenues above a certain threshold.
The licence model gives the public authority very little control over how the private partner maintains
and manages the EV charging network. Instead, the licence model’s approach relies heavily on the
private partner’s natural incentive to maintain the network and thus maximise user revenues and its
return on investment.
There are numerous ways to structure the joint venture model, but each typically involves both parties
bearing any fall in user revenues due to a poorly maintained network.
Objective 3
Achieve high levels of user satisfaction with public EV charging services
User confidence in and satisfaction with public EV charging are critical for the transition from traditional
vehicles to EVs. These are influenced by not only the availability and reliability of charging points (see
objective 2 above) but also users’ overall experience of the EV charging services (for instance, price
transparency, ease of payment, accessibility, problem responsiveness, and complaint handling).8 The
different partnering models offer the public authority different levels of control over the quality of the
EV charging services that users experience.
8 The European Commission’s evaluation of the 2014/94/EU Directive identifies that the “lack of interoperable, easy-to use charging and refuelling infrastructure
is likely to become a barrier to the needed market growth of low- and zero-emission vehicles.” See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.

ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING CONCESSIONS: A CONTRACT GUIDE FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES13
In the public contract, concession and availability-based models, the public authority can specify
standards and requirements that the private partner must meet in the ongoing EV service delivery.
These can be backed up by, for example, deductions from service payments (public contract model),
deductions from availability payments (availability-based model) or the imposition of penalties
(concession model). Of these, the availability-based and concession models provide the strongest
incentive for the private partner to comply with contractual service standards and requirements,
because any deductions or penalties imposed will affect the private partner’s ability to repay the
upfront infrastructure investment. Under a public contract, by contrast, the investment in infrastructure
is a sunk cost for the public authority.
The concession model also creates a natural incentive for the private partner to provide a good quality
service, as its return from user revenues will rise by attracting more customers. This incentive does not
exist in the public contract or availability-based models, where the risk/reward of user demand lies
with the public authority.
The licence model usually imposes very few conditions on service standards and has limited incentive
and enforcement mechanisms.
The joint venture model could be structured to impose service-related obligations (backed up by an
incentive and/or penalty mechanism), but both parties typically bear any fall in user revenues resulting
from poor customer service.
O bjective 4
Reach areas with low user demand (current and/or projected)
The revenue-generating potential of EV charging points varies greatly from place to place (for example
inner-city zones vs. rural areas). Market forces alone will drive private sector parties towards installing
EV charging infrastructure in areas with opportunities for higher, faster and safer investment returns.
In some places, the problem might be slow EV uptake, meaning that charging points are not yet
profitable but will become so over time. In other places, the problem might be low population density,
meaning there will never be enough demand to make charging points profitable. Each partnering
model has scope to deliver EV charging infrastructure in areas the market would otherwise ignore.
The public contract and availability-based models are simplest to negotiate and implement in
this respect. The public authority identifies locations needing investment and the private partner is
contractually obliged to install the infrastructure in those areas. The public authority bears user-demand
risk and is obliged to pay the private partner9 irrespective of the profitability of charging points.
Under the concession and licence models, where the private partner bears user-demand risk,
unprofitable (or less profitable) locations need to be bundled with more profitable locations to ensure
the private partner will make a reasonable return on its investment within a reasonable timeframe.10
However, for a public authority, the “hands-off” nature of a licence arrangement gives limited assurance
of the private partner delivering and sustaining the desired investment and operation in unprofitable
locations over time. By contrast, through various contractual mechanisms, the concession model gives
the public authority much more control over delivery of the EV charging infrastructure investment and
the long-term availability and performance of the investment (see objectives 1, 2 and 3 above).
9 The public authority pays on installation under the public contract model or through regular availability payments under the availability-based model
10 In the concession model, the authority could alternatively provide some form of support (e.g. subsidies or guarantees) to mitigate the risk that unprofitable locations
pose to the private partner.
PART 1: DECIDING TO USE A CONCESSION MODEL14
The joint venture model could incorporate a remit to reach areas with various levels of demand and
profitability. However, compared to other partnering models, a joint venture is more likely to give the
public authority less control and certainty on reaching and servicing unprofitable areas.
Objective 5
Create and/or maintain a competitive market for EV charging that drives fair prices for users
A central message of most strategies promoting EV uptake is the low running costs of EVs compared to
internal combustion engine vehicles. For this reason, a public authority will want to ensure that prices
are fair and reasonable for users.
Primarily, this requires the public authority to run a robust and efficient procurement process that
drives healthy competition among those bidding for the contract. To back this up, the public authority
could use contractual provisions to ensure fair and reasonable prices for users. With no such controls, a
dominant market player might emerge (at street/area/city level, for instance), with freedom to charge
users unreasonably high prices. Price controls also allow a public authority to maintain price parity
across different locations.
In the public contract and availability-based models, the public authority controls the operation of
the infrastructure and keeps the revenues it generates. It therefore has complete freedom to determine
the prices charged to users.
The concession model allows a public authority to fix or cap (or otherwise regulate) pricing in the
contract. However, as the private partner must generate enough user revenues to profit from its
investment, the public authority should consider how contractual price controls might affect the
private partner’s willingness to bear user-demand risk. Depending on the private partner’s assessment
of user-demand risk when bidding for the concession, it might seek support (such as guarantees or
subsidies) from the public authority to mitigate that risk if price adjustments are constrained.
The licence model typically gives the public authority limited (if any) control over pricing, which is
instead managed either naturally through competition or, in some cases, by a public regulator.
Arrangements in the joint venture model could be structured with any level of control over pricing.
As in the concession model, however, private sector participation in the venture will depend on its
assessment of risk and ability to make a return.
Objective 6
Integrate EV charging within a wider eco-mobility strategy
Increasing the number of EV charging points is usually just one element of a public authority’s wider
eco-mobility strategy. Other elements might include subsidies to purchase EVs or a ban on diesel
vehicles in inner-city areas. A public authority should be mindful of the interactions between individual
elements of its strategy, and of the limitations of different partnering models in accommodating
strategy changes over time.
ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING CONCESSIONS: A CONTRACT GUIDE FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES15
Changes to EV charging infrastructure
A change or development in overall strategy might prompt the public authority to seek to change the
EV charging infrastructure and/or systems after signing the contract (e.g. to switch to fast chargers,
integrate the user interface with a city-wide system/app, or concentrate charging points in hub areas).
In the licence model, the public authority usually has no right to instruct the private partner to change
the EV charging infrastructure or service. Under the public contract model, by contrast, the public
authority is free to alter the infrastructure or service at its own cost. Similarly, the public authority is
usually free to instruct changes under the concession or availability-based model, although the
complex nature of these models can often make such changes difficult and costly to negotiate. In
the joint venture model, changes to the EV charging infrastructure or service will typically be a joint
decision, with the costs shared according to the parties’ stakes in the arrangement.
Changes to other elements of the eco-mobility strategy
Under the licence model, the private partner bears the risk of how other elements of the strategy
impact the performance or profitability of the EV charging infrastructure (lower user revenues, for
instance, because the public authority decides not to implement a ban on diesel vehicles). In the
concession model, however, it is more common for the private partner to seek guarantees from the
public authority on the implementation of other strategy elements (such as the EV subsidy scheme
continuing for a minimum period). Under the public contract and availability-based models, the
interaction between the EV charging infrastructure’s performance and profitability and other strategy
elements is borne by the public authority.
Objective 7
Use private sector capital and minimise the impact on public finances
Except for the public contract model, which relies on public authority financing, all the partnering
models provide an opportunity to deploy private sector capital. This reduces the need for the public
authority to commit financial resources to upfront investment in EV charging infrastructure.
In the licence or concession model, the private partner makes the upfront investment in the EV
charging infrastructure. If demand will likely exceed the level required to generate a reasonable
return over a reasonable timeframe, the public authority might even demand a fee or share of the
revenues, in return for granting the licence or concession (thus impacting positively on public finances).
Conversely, if demand is unlikely to be sufficient, a licence or concession might only be viable if the
public authority agrees to provide financial support (such as a guarantee or subsidy).
Likewise, in the availability-based model, the private partner makes the upfront investment. However,
this model requires the public authority to pay periodic fees that cover repayment of the investment
over the contract duration and to bear the risk of user revenues proving insufficient to cover those
fees. The availability-based model can be structured to allow the public authority to contribute some
capital to the upfront investment, thereby reducing the size of periodic fees. A public authority might
choose to do this if, for example, it receives a lump-sum grant from a national authority, ring-fenced for
this purpose.
The financing and funding arrangements of the joint venture model can be structured according to
the parties’ particular resources, objectives, and constraints.
PART 1: DECIDING TO USE A CONCESSION MODEL16
Objective 8
Deploy private sector expertise and resources
Limited expertise and resources within a public authority might influence its choice of a partnering
model.
The public contract model typically requires more technical know-how and expertise from the
public authority, which needs to understand and define its technical and service requirements in very
prescriptive “input” terms. By contrast, the concession and availability-based models tend to specify
requirements in “output” terms, requiring the public authority to define the outcomes or outputs it
expects but not the inputs needed to achieve them.11
The licence model is the least demanding on public authority expertise and resources, leaving the
private partner largely free to design, install and operate EV charging infrastructure as it chooses,
within only limited constraints.
The joint venture model allows the public authority to draw in whatever type and level of private
sector resources and expertise it needs. However, the success of this partnering model relies heavily
on the public authority’s ability to drive the joint venture towards its founding objectives. The public
authority therefore requires specific expertise to continually manage the private partner, in addition to
a good understanding of EV business models.
Conclusion
Choosing a partnering model
The public authority’s assessment of how the various models align with its objectives, and ultimately
its selection of a partnering model, will take account of a range of financial (quantitative) and non-
financial (qualitative) factors including (but not limited to):
• costs of installation, maintenance and operation; forecast utilisation; envisaged tariff structure;
• availability of public finances and the implications of the various partnering models under rules for
budgeting, accounting and statistical treatment (Eurostat);12
• market capacity (skills and resources) and appetite (interest, understanding, attitude to risk and
investment size) to deliver what the partnering models require;
• public authority capacity (skills and resources) and appetite (interest) to procure and deliver
what the partnering models demand, in terms of legal obligations and ongoing monitoring and
management needs;
11 In any of these three models, cooperation at a regional and/or national level allows public authority expertise to be shared or aggregated.
12 Budgeting and accounting rules apply at the level of the relevant public authority, governing how the authority budgets and accounts for expenditure and income
under the partnering model. Statistical treatment rules apply at the level of national government, governing how expenditure and income under the partnering
model affects national debt and deficit figures.
ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING CONCESSIONS: A CONTRACT GUIDE FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES17
• the public authority’s preferred level of influence over the development and performance of the
public EV charging infrastructure network (such as service quality, pricing, spatial development,
market organisation);
• impact on the shape, size and competitiveness of the EV charging market (for example, risk of
crowding-out or deterring new entrants);
• flexibility of the various partnering models to adapt to changes in laws, policies and/or regulations;
• requirements and restrictions of relevant laws and regulations (for instance, relating to public
contracts);
• estimated time to procure a contract and roll out the EV charging infrastructure under the various
partnering models.
The choice of partnering model requires complex analyses and decision-making. The public authority
will need to follow a process that ultimately enables a robust “value for money” judgment on the best
use of public resources.

the concession contract2
PPAARRTT 2
Structure and content of
the concession contract2211
Structure and content of the concession contract
The public authority will start to prepare the concession contract after:
• defining the scope of the EV infrastructure procurement;13
• determining that a concession is the optimal partnering model.
Part 2 of the guide is structured around 13 contract themes and explains the typical features of a
concession arrangement for public EV charging infrastructure. It explores the risks and issues
associated with each theme and how these are approached in the concession contract. The public
authority objectives mentioned in these themes are typically those described in Part 1 of this guide.
For some themes, the guide suggests some public authority support measures that, depending on
the circumstances, might be appropriate or even necessary to enhance or address concerns about the
concession’s viability or deliverability.
Building on the description in Part 1 of this guide, Part 2 assumes that an EV charging infrastructure
concession is an arrangement between a public authority and a private partner in which:
• the private partner is responsible for installing, maintaining and operating publicly available EV
charging infrastructure for a defined time period;
• the private partner provides some (or all) of the financing required to design, purchase, install,
operate and maintain the EV charging infrastructure;
• the private partner has a direct relationship with users and collects and retains revenues from
them;
• the private partner’s revenues fluctuate according to user demand and/or the standard to which it
performs its obligations.
The success of a concession contract in meeting a public authority’s objectives will depend
on not only the content of the concession contract (this guide’s focus) but also the public
authority’s commitment to managing the contract’s implementation. Throughout
the contract, the public authority needs to allocate appropriate time and resources to
monitoring the private partner’s performance and enforcing the contractual terms to realise
the full value and opportunity of the concession arrangement.
13 The precise definition of EV charging infrastructure depends on the scope of the private partner’s obligations (see footnote 4). It can include any or all of the following:
grid upgrades; grid connections; charging points; systems, devices, applications and components for the user interface. The viability of the scope of an EV concession
contract should be tested with the market in advance of procurement.
PART 2: STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF THE CONCESSION CONTRACT22
Theme 1
Duration
The contract should clearly state the duration of the arrangement and any process for its renewal or
extension. In setting the contract duration, the public authority will be mindful of:
• the period of time needed for the private partner to recover its investment and make a
reasonable return;
• the amount of public funds available to support the concession if required (e.g. shorter duration
might increase the need for public support);
• the likelihood of shifts in the EV market and/or technology (avoiding being locked into long-term
contracts for redundant infrastructure);
• whether the underlying objectives are short-term (e.g. testing or demonstrating a concept) or
long-term (e.g. creating a large-scale public service);
• maintaining a healthy and competitive market (avoiding overly long contracts with single
providers, particularly if exclusivity is granted);
• legal restrictions;14
• time and resources needed to prepare and run procurements for future concessions (i.e. how often
the public authority wants to undertake this exercise);
• interfaces with any other relevant contracts.
The contract typically distinguishes between an installation period, within which the private partner
must install the public EV charging infrastructure, and an exploitation period, during which the
private partner is entitled to operate and receive income from the EV charging infrastructure. In many
contracts, these two periods will overlap, enabling the private partner to start generating revenues
from the first charging points it installs while continuing to install further charging points.
Contracts often give the private partner exclusivity over installing EV charging points on public land
during the installation period.
14 One example is laws implementing Directive 2014/23/EU, particularly Article 18, which states that a concession’s duration should not exceed the time needed to
recover the investment made and a return thereon.
ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING CONCESSIONS: A CONTRACT GUIDE FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES2233
Theme 2
Sites
Selecting sites
The contract will identify sites for installation of the EV charging infrastructure, and/or potential sites
where the private partner is expected to develop the network in response to projected or actual
demand arising during the contract.
These sites might be selected by the public authority before procurement, based on an assessment of
how best to meet its objectives (network coverage and balance, for instance) within any constraints
(such as available land or planning conditions). The public authority might invite bidders to propose
additional or alternative sites during the procurement process. if accepted by the public authority,
these sites are then included in the contract. The contract itself can also offer flexibility for the private
partner to propose additional or alternative sites during the installation period. Some contracts even
financially incentivise the private partner to minimise use of public land and instead find alternative
private sites that still meet public demand. For instance, a private partner able to do this might pay
reduced concession fees to the public authority. The public authority’s approval is usually required for
changes to sites specified in the contract.
Ownership and access
The public authority typically retains ownership of the sites and, in the contract, grants rights of access
to the private partner for installing, maintaining and operating the EV charging infrastructure on those
sites. Conversely, the contract will make the private partner responsible for arranging whatever access
rights it needs for any proposed alternative sites not owned by the public authority.
Site conditions
Many contracts are silent about the suitability or condition of the sites, which implies that the private
partner bears the risk and responsibility for any difficulty, delay or cost caused by unexpected site
conditions (such as contamination). In practice, adverse ground conditions are unlikely to cause
problems for the installation and operation of most public EV charging infrastructure, which will
typically be located at the roadside. Looking at PPP practice in other sectors, there are some support
measures that the public authority might consider taking in relation to site conditions. These include, in
increasing order of supportiveness:
• disclosing to bidders, during the procurement, any site surveys undertaken by the public authority;
• guaranteeing the accuracy and/or completeness of such surveys;
• if sites cannot be surveyed before contract award, including a contractual provision allowing the
private partner to claim relief and/or compensation if it encounters any adverse site conditions (see
Theme 10).
The extent to which these types of measures are necessary or appropriate to enhance competition and
drive a better value solution for users will depend on the project’s specific circumstances. These include
the amount of publicly available information; the level of interest from potential bidders; the cost, time
and disruption of multiple surveys; and issues encountered on previous projects in the area.
PART 2: STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF THE CONCESSION CONTRACT24
Theme 3
Design and installation of EV charging infrastructure
Overall approach
The conventional approach to design and installation of EV charging infrastructure includes the
following elements:
• Technical specifications: the private partner is required to design and install EV charging
infrastructure that meets the public authority’s technical specifications for the hardware (for
example, user-friendly design of charging points, signage, spatial integration, grid connections,
hardware interoperability) and software (such as metering requirements, remote connectivity,
system interoperability, cybersecurity). The specifications will likely refer to other industry design
standards and specifications, as well as relevant laws and regulations (see Theme 9).
• Process: the contract might specify procedures the private partner must follow during the
installation phase. For instance, if the contract requires installation in response to user demand, it
may set a particular procedure from receipt of a user application through to site identification and
finally completion of the installation.
• Permits and authorisations: the private partner is obliged to obtain all permits and authorisations
necessary for installing and operating the EV charging infrastructure (such as planning consent).
• Grid connections (new): where any new grid connection is required, the private partner is
responsible for securing agreement with the grid operator and for the time and cost of the
connection works.
• Grid connections (existing): if the private partner is taking over an existing grid connection, it is
responsible for transferring the existing agreement.
• Programme: the private partner is required to meet certain deadlines in the installation phase. For
instance, the contract may stipulate the installation of [x] charging points at [specific locations] or
the achievement of [kWh] of available charging capacity by [date], or require the installation of a
charging point within [y] months of a user application.15 The opportunity to start generating user
revenues creates a natural incentive for the private partner to install the EV charging infrastructure
quickly. However, the public authority will have a programme in mind for implementing the
project and achieving its underlying objectives. Setting deadlines in the contract will increase the
certainty of meeting these aims. Failure by the private partner to meet these deadlines should lead
to penalties appropriate to the project’s scale and market practice in the sector (e.g. liquidated
damages) and/or ultimately to the contract’s ea rly termination (see Theme 12).
• Approval: before the private partner starts work, the public authority often has the contractual
right to review and approve the design of the EV charging infrastructure (hardware and software),
design of the network (the final positioning of individual stations relative to one another) and
the installation programme. Thereafter, the public authority will reserve the right to approve any
changes to these.
15 Obligations in the installation programme will depend on the underlying strategy for developing the EV charging network — see footnote 4 above.
ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING CONCESSIONS: A CONTRACT GUIDE FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES2255
• Health & safety: the private partner is responsible for complying with all relevant health and safety
laws, regulations and good practice.
• Monitoring: the public authority typically has the right to monitor the installation’s progress and its
compliance with the technical specifications and requirements.
Exceptions
The time and cost of designing and installing the EV charging infrastructure under the approach
described above are the private partner’s risk and responsibility. Nevertheless, contracts often contain
exceptions allowing the private partner to claim relief and/or compensation from the public authority
(see Theme 10). Some contracts create a general exception, such as for any circumstances beyond the
private partner’s control. However, best practice is for the contract to list a limited number of specific
exceptions. This creates much more certainty for both parties and is particularly recommended for
exceptions with a direct financial impact on the public authority (when compensation is payable).
Theme 10 provides further guidance on these exceptions and the mechanisms through which they can
be applied.
Additional support measures
The public authority might also consider additional measures to support the design and installation of
the EV charging infrastructure, such as:
• ensuring its planning and permitting regime supports the installation of EV charging points.
This does not form part of the contract but will affect the market’s appetite for and approach to
the concession arrangement;
• undertaking in the contract to cooperate and facilitate the private partner’s applications for permits
and authorisations;
• using regional, national and/or other known industry standards and specifications, with which the
market is familiar;
• carrying out preparatory surveys and grid connection works and/or securing grid connection
agreements (including on costs) in advance of the concession contract award;
• undertaking in the contract to obtain the required grid connections, with failure resulting in relief
and/or compensation (see Theme 10);
• granting capital subsidies for the purchase and/or installation costs (see Theme 6).
PART 2: STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF THE CONCESSION CONTRACT26
Theme 4
Operation of the EV charging infrastructure and services
The private partner is naturally incentivised to maintain the EV charging infrastructure and provide
quality services for users. Non- or poorly functioning EV charging infrastructure and poor services will
likely generate lower user revenues. However, this natural incentive may not always be strong enough
to ensure the public authority’s underlying objectives are met. For example, the private partner
might be disinclined to repair a charging point in a low-demand area, which would be contrary to the
underlying objective of ensuring a balanced network. The private partner might also be less inclined to
deliver quality customer services if customers have no realistic charging alternatives, which would be
contrary to the underlying objective of increasing EV uptake.
Performance requirements and standards
To reinforce the private partner’s natural incentives, the public authority should use the contract
to specify its requirements and set standards for any or all operational aspects of the EV charging
infrastructure and services. The precise requirements and standards will vary for each project,
depending on the public authority’s objectives and priorities. As a starting point, however, the contract
will typically require the private partner to ensure a certain level of overall performance of the EV
charging infrastructure network. Depending on the public authority’s underlying objectives and the
stage of EV market development in its area, overall performance might be measured by, for example:
• the “uptime” of all charging points installed to date under the contract;
• the available charging capacity available across the area at any point in time.
Some contracts apply different indicators of performance at different stages. For example, during
the installation period, the private partner must respond to demand and ensure a certain level of
available charging capacity (as demand increases, it must install new charging points). Then, once the
installation period ends, the private partner must ensure the “uptime” of the charging points it has
installed.
The private partner’s performance might also be measured by more detailed requirements and
standards relating to, for example:
• accessibility of the EV charging infrastructure to users (for instance, interaction with parking policy,
interface with subscribers vs. one-off users);
• accessibility of the EV charging infrastructure to e-mobility service providers;
• functionality of the EV charging infrastructure (such as how quickly charging starts, availability of
real-time charging information);
• number of service failures and timescales for responding to them;
• procedures and timescales for dealing with user enquiries, calls for assistance and complaints;
• procedures and timescales for inspections, maintenance and repairs;
ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING CONCESSIONS: A CONTRACT GUIDE FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES2277
• policy on energy resources (e.g. renewable energy use, user choice of energy source);
• pricing policy and transparency, and user payment procedures (see Theme 5);
• reporting to and sharing data with the public authority (for monitoring contract performance,
monitoring use and/or informing the public authority’s overall EV strategy);
• inspection and monitoring rights for the public authority.
Creating a performance mechanism
To create meaningful incentives, the contractual requirements and standards concerning operation
of the EV charging infrastructure and services must be accompanied by provisions for performance
monitoring and reporting, as well as sanctions for non-performance. Collectively, the provisions on
obligations, monitoring, reporting and sanctions comprise the “performance mechanism.”
There are numerous ways to approach and structure the performance mechanism in the contract,
but good practice is to create a separate list or schedule of requirements and standards. These are
often referred to as “performance measures,” and need to be defined to allow clear and objective
measurement of whether or not they have been met. Some performance measures may be directly
linked to the functioning of the EV charging infrastructure and services (including an obligation to
respond within a certain period to maintenance issues). Others may be more general in nature and
relate to management of the contract (such as submitting monthly reports to the public authority).
The contract should set out requirements for regular monitoring and reporting against the
performance measures. Most contracts permit self-reporting by the private partner but entitle the
public authority to dual-monitor and/or audit the private partner’s reports. Some performance
measures will relate to obligations that must be met routinely, such as submitting monthly reports
to the public authority, whereas others will need to be met and measured on an ad hoc basis, such as
responding to maintenance requests.
For each performance measure, the sanction for non-performance should be clear and objective. Some
contracts allocate a fixed monetary value to each performance measure, and apply this amount as
a financial penalty when a failure occurs. Other contracts have a system that allocates performance
points to each failure and then a monetary value to performance points. Both approaches can include
weightings that reflect the performance measure’s importance and the impact of failure: for example,
not responding to an emergency assistance call attracts a higher penalty than late delivery of a
report, while a one-day delay in completing a repair attracts a lower penalty than a one-week delay.
The public authority needs to consider the appropriateness and fairness of the level of such penalties:
the overall objective is to create the right incentives for the private partner to deliver without being
overly punitive.
For some failures, it might be appropriate to allow a remedy period before applying a penalty. The remedy
period might be embedded in the performance measure itself: for instance, a defect in the EV charging
infrastructure might only be considered a failure if not rectified within 24 hours. Alternatively, the remedy
period might apply after a failure occurs: for example, a defect in the EV charging infrastructure is an
automatic failure but a 24-hour remedy period is then allowed before applying a deduction.
PART 2: STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF THE CONCESSION CONTRACT28
Performance is typically measured (and reported) monthly, although the public authority might also
require real-time access to certain information and data. Any financial penalties are typically applied
monthly or annually. Financial penalties are often capped at an annual amount and/or aggregate amount
over the contract duration.
If the public authority pays some form of operating subsidy, the financial penalty imposed on the private
partner is usually deducted from that subsidy. Otherwise, the penalty might be due as a payment by the
private partner or added to any concession fees payable.
Operating costs and risks
Save for any payments (see Theme 5) or relief and compensation (see Theme 10) payable by the public
authority under the contract, the private partner bears the risks and costs associated with operating the
EV charging infrastructure and services in accordance with the contractual requirements and standards.
The private partner’s responsibilities include securing the supply of energy (sometimes with restrictions,
such as only using renewable energy), and its risks include energy-cost fluctuations (usually with
provision for indexation if charging prices are restricted by the contract — see Theme 5).
Some contracts might require the private partner to take on responsibility for the ongoing operation and
maintenance of existing EV charging infrastructure. Its willingness to do so will depend on factors such
as the infrastructure’s age and specifications, the availability of manufacturer warranties and guarantees,
and information on current revenues. To avoid bidders overpricing this risk during the procurement
process, the public authority can make information on the existing EV charging infrastructure available
to all bidders. In some extreme cases, the private partner might insist on the public authority taking or
sharing this risk. This can be achieved through the authority providing relief or compensation if defects
arise (see Theme 10) or undertaking to pursue claims against manufacturer warranties and guarantees
that cannot be transferred to the private partner.
ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING CONCESSIONS: A CONTRACT GUIDE FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES2299
Theme 5
Payments and pricing
User pricing and payments
The principal payments in a concession are those by users to the private partner. The contract typically
imposes conditions on the prices that can be charged to users and on the payment scheme operated
by the private partner, often specifying:
• any maximum, minimum and/or average prices the private partner is entitled to charge users, or
other price-setting guidelines;
• the extent to which the private partner may or must use differential pricing models, for instance by
differentiating between subscribers and ad hoc users, or between the time of day and duration of
occupation of a charging point, to incentivise use at times of low energy demand;
• any requirements on user connection fees and payment plans; visibility, transparency and stability
of prices for users; interaction with parking policy and parking charges;
• any permissions or restrictions on generating revenues from advertising space on EV charging
infrastructure;
• any permissions or restrictions on offering other services such as smart-charging or access to
4G and 5G networks;
• the basis of any routine price adjustment for indexation;
• the basis of any adjustment for fluctuations in energy costs;
• the consequences of changes in energy tax (for instance whether the cost of these changes can be
passed on to users).
The public authority will likely want some control over prices. Concessions create an environment,
albeit regulated, in which one or more market players operate. Without price controls, users would be
forced to pay whatever prices the private partner determined. A lack of control could also lead to large
pricing differentials across different EV charging point operators and to users being charged different
prices according to the area where they live: such outcomes are likely to be undesirable from a public
policy perspective.
However, strict price regulation might be difficult for bidders to accept in new markets where demand
is insufficient and/or unstable and therefore difficult to predict. It may also prove difficult in situations
where underlying costs (e.g. for energy) are unstable and unpredictable. In such circumstances,
the private partner might ask the public authority for additional support measures to mitigate user-
demand risk. Such measures might include, for example, capital subsidies or adjustment to prices for
exceptional increases in energy costs. In return for any such support measures, the public authority
might demand a share of higher-than-expected revenues that might arise if demand increases or
stabilises or if other revenue-generating opportunities materialise.
PART 2: STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF THE CONCESSION CONTRACT30
In some markets, the public authority sets the charging prices for users during the contract
procurement stage. Bidders are therefore evaluated principally on their technical solutions and the
amount of any concession fee they propose to pay, and/or any subsidy they require from, the public
authority. This set price assumes certain underlying energy costs, and so is adjusted (e.g. annually) in
line with movements in these costs. The private partner bears the risk of energy-cost movements in
between these regular adjustments. When energy costs are extremely volatile, this might prove too
burdensome for the private partner. It might, therefore, be worth considering additional contract
mechanisms to account for this situation: for instance, a provision could stipulate that an increase of at
least [x]% in energy costs will trigger an exceptional interim indexation adjustment.
Other payments
Besides any liquidated damages for installation delays (see Theme 3) and penalties for substandard
performance (see Theme 4), the contract also needs to specify the terms and conditions for the
following potential payments:
• concession fees payable by the private partner to the public authority;
• any capital subsidies from the public authority (i.e. payments towards the costs of purchasing and
installing EV charging infrastructure);
• any guarantee payments or operating subsidies from the public authority.
Concession fees do not feature in every EV charging infrastructure concession contract. The public
authority’s decision on whether to demand concession fees, and the appropriate structure of the
concession fee mechanism, will depend on the context of the specific concession arrangement.
Concession fees need to be factored into the overall economics of the project, and ultimately be
covered by revenues the private partner receives from users (and therefore reflected in user prices).
For the first concession in an immature EV market, it may not be viable to demand any concession
fees, or payment of concession fees might only be triggered if and when the concession performs
exceptionally well. As the EV market matures, concession fees might become standard practice and the
mechanisms more favourable to the public authority. Examples of concession fee mechanisms include:
• a single upfront payment on signature of the concession contract;
• regular fixed payments for each site on which EV charging infrastructure is installed (akin to rent);
• a percentage share of revenues or profits above a certain threshold or once specific targets (e.g. kWh
per use, occupancy rate) are met;
• a fixed payment per kWh of charge.
In practice, concession fees structured as a percentage share of revenues or profits on an ongoing basis
have been found to work well. These types of arrangement keep both parties interested and engaged
in the continuing performance and success of the concession.
The rationale for demanding concession fees is strengthened where the public authority financially
contributes toward the capital or operating costs because the concession fees give the public authority
some return on its investment.
ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING CONCESSIONS: A CONTRACT GUIDE FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES3311
For capital subsidies (see Theme 6), the contract should be clear on the timing and any conditions to
which these are linked, such as evidence of successfully installing equipment, so as to minimise the risk
to the public authority of losing its contribution (e.g. due to private partner insolvency).
Operating subsidies (see Theme 6) can take various forms. Once again, the contract simply needs to
be clear on the timing and conditions for these payments becoming due. They might, for example,
be payable monthly, quarterly or annually; in advance or arrears; firm or contingent on a shortfall of
revenues or cash flow.
By making the payment of operating subsidies conditional on proper performance of the EV charging
infrastructure and services, the public authority strengthens the private partner’s incentives to
perform: it cannot simply avoid maintenance, watch demand fall and call on the guarantee. This, in
turn, gives the public authority greater assurance of achieving its underlying objectives, such as greater
uptake of EV in its area. In this regard, the contract should contain:
• clear and objective indicators against which performance can be measured to determine the payment
due (see Theme 5). These might not fully capture the performance of each and every element of the
services but should capture key elements;
• a mechanism for varying payments according to the level of performance achieved (a percentage
reduction or fixed deduction for each indicator breached, for example). The mechanism might
attribute different weightings to different indicators: for example, a functional failure of an EV
charging point might attract a higher financial penalty than a delay in providing data and reports to
the public authority. The financial penalty for an instance of poor performance will likely also vary
according to how long the poor performance persists. See Theme 4 for further guidance.
PART 2: STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF THE CONCESSION CONTRACT32
Theme 6
Financing and public authority support
Availability and cost of financing
The private partner is typically responsible for financing the costs of designing, purchasing, installing,
operating and maintaining the EV charging infrastructure. It may look to banks and investors to source
the money it needs for this. The availability and cost of financing for the private partner will be driven by
the overall economics of the proposed concession arrangement, and should, therefore, be addressed by
the public authority through early market sounding when considering the concession model.
Public authority financial measures to improve the concession’s viability
The public authority might need or decide to adopt certain support measures to improve the viability
of the concession arrangement, particularly where forecast user revenues are insufficient for the
private partner to meet its upfront investment and operating costs. This will, in turn, help the private
partner raise financing from banks, equity investors or other sources. Such measures can include:
• capital subsidy: a contribution to the cost of purchasing and installing the EV charging
infrastructure, typically at the end of (or at milestones during) the contract’s installation phase;
• minimum revenue guarantee: an undertaking by the public authority that if revenue falls below a
specific level, it will pay the private partner the amount needed for its revenue to reach a certain level;
• cash flow guarantee: an undertaking by the public authority that if the private partner’s net cash
flow (i.e. revenues minus operating costs) falls below a specific level, the public authority will pay
the private partner the amount needed for its net cash flow to reach a certain level;
• fixed operating subsidy: regular fixed payments made by the public authority during the
operation and maintenance phase;
• availability payments: regular fixed payments made during the operation and maintenance phase,
adjusted according to the availability (i.e. functionality) of the EV charging infrastructure and/or
the quality of the private partner’s performance.
The amount and timing of any such support measures need to be determined on a project-specific
basis, according to factors such as:
• the “viability gap” — based on market sounding, what is the optimum contribution needed to
ensure that bids will be received for the contract and at the same time keep bidders motivated to
assess and consider how to manage user demand risk adequately?;
• the public authority’s “value for money,” affordability and budgeting constraints — for example,
whether an upfront lump-sum payment is better than an ongoing contribution over several years;
the likelihood of a guarantee being called upon balanced against the certainty of an upfront payment.
ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING CONCESSIONS: A CONTRACT GUIDE FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES3333
If the public authority is making any financial contribution to the concession arrangement, the contract
should clearly specify the timing and conditions for such payments (see Theme 5). Committing to make
such financial contributions strengthens the rationale for the public authority including the following
provisions in the contract:
• performance standards for the operation and maintenance of the EV charging infrastructure and
a mechanism to penalise poor performance. These will incentivise the private partner to perform
and not rely solely on the guarantee, ultimately ensuring the functionality of the investment
being supported and the public authority’s underlying objectives in entering into the concession
arrangement (see Theme 4);
• a concession fee mechanism that allows the public authority to share in revenues (perhaps above
a certain threshold and/or after a period of time) that the private partner generates from the EV
charging infrastructure (see Theme 5);
• recognition of any public authority financial contributions in the financial settlement between the
parties on early contract termination (see Theme 12);
• a requirement that the EV charging infrastructure is in an appropriate condition (commensurate with
proper maintenance during the contract) when handed back to the public authority on contract
expiry (see Theme 13).
Other public authority support measures
To further support the private partner in taking the financing and user-demand risks associated with
the concession arrangement, the public authority could, for example:
• contractually guarantee the private partner exclusivity for installing and/or operating EV charging
infrastructure in the relevant area within a certain time period;
• introduce wider public policy measures promoting the uptake of EVs by individuals and businesses
in the relevant area (such as tax incentives, subsidies for EV purchases, information for users on
how to request an EV charging point, clear and efficient planning and other approval processes).
Although these are not contractual, a supportive environment for EVs can influence how the market
approaches the concession contract.
PART 2: STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF THE CONCESSION CONTRACT34
Theme 7
Insurance
The contract should specify the insurance policies that the private partner must have in place. These usually
include:
• professional indemnity insurance;
• construction/property damage insurance;
• public liability insurance.
For each required form of insurance,, the contract typically specifies key terms, such as minimum
and maximum coverage and specific inclusions or exclusions. The public authority might seek to be
a “named party” on the insurance policies depending on its own insurance arrangements. Insurance
requirements in a concession contract strongly influence the market’s willingness to bid and approach
to bidding, so public authorities need to take expert insurance advice on setting these requirements at
appropriate levels.
The availability of insurance and fluctuations in insurance costs are typically private partner risks. If
insurance risks prove too problematic for the market (for unusually long contracts, for example), the
public authority might consider providing support measures often used in PPPs in other sectors, such
as:
• sharing the cost of insurance premiums if they increase above a specified threshold (and,
correspondingly, sharing the benefit of the premiums if they fall below a specified threshold);
• treating the unavailability of insurance as a force majeure event, which could ultimately lead to
early contract termination (see Theme 12);
• a contractual provision allowing the public authority to step in as insurer of last resort should
insurance become unavailable (as an alternative to early termination for force majeure).
However, these support measures should be explored only in exceptional circumstances.
ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING CONCESSIONS: A CONTRACT GUIDE FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES3355
Theme 8
Changes
The parties are typically free to amend the contract by mutual agreement in accordance with the laws
in force in the jurisdiction. However, the contract itself usually explicitly recognises either party’s right
to request changes and sets out a process that structures the negotiation of changes.
In general, the public authority will have the right to request any change. The private partner might
have grounds on which it can refuse a change, but these should be specific and limited in number.
For instance, the private partner might be permitted to refuse a change that would lead to an
unreasonable shift in the contract’s nature or risk profile, or a change for which required permissions or
consents would be impossible to obtain. The public authority is typically required to ensure the private
partner is left in a no-better/no-worse position as a result of the change, for instance through financial
compensation and/or other forms of relief under the contract.
Likewise, the private partner will have the right to propose any change, although the public authority
is more likely to retain absolute discretion to refuse any change not required by a change in the law.
As far as possible, it is advisable to agree in advance and specify in the contract the consequences
of certain types of change, for instance by fixing the amount of compensation the public authority
must pay if it demands the removal or relocation of EV charging infrastructure. This not only provides
certainty on the costs of implementing changes but also helps to minimise the time and cost involved
in negotiating changes.
PART 2: STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF THE CONCESSION CONTRACT36
Theme 9
Complying with laws and regulations
The contract requires the private partner to comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the
design, installation, operation and maintenance of the EV charging infrastructure and services. Relevant
laws and regulations might change over the course of the contract, and these changes might require
additional capital expenditure (changes to hardware or software to ensure interoperability, for instance)
or operating expenses (such as more frequent safety checks).
The longer the contract duration, the greater the risk that legislative or regulatory changes will lead
to additional costs and the more difficult this may be for the private partner to bear. Some concession
contracts permit the private partner to pass on the costs of a change in law to users by increasing
its prices. In contracts that restrict price changes, the public authority might consider it appropriate
to take on or share some of this risk, to enhance the viability or “value for money” of the concession
arrangement.
To date, many EV concession contracts state simply that the parties should discuss and agree how to
apportion change-in-law costs (on a fair and reasonable basis, for instance) whenever the situation
arises. However, an “agreement to agree” of this nature creates contractual uncertainty and the
potential for disputes to arise. To ensure more certainty on change-in-law risk allocation, an EV
concession contract could draw on the various mechanisms often used in PPP contracts in other
sectors. These include:
• treating a change in law that requires capital expenditure as a compensation event (see Theme 10),
triggering a direct payment by the public authority to cover the private partner’s increased costs or
allowing the private partner to recover the increased costs by other means (such as a price increase
or contract extension);
• an undertaking by the public authority to contribute a certain percentage of any increased capital
expenditure required as a result of a change in law;
• extending either of the two mechanisms above to also cover increased operating expenditure;
• limiting any of the three mechanisms above to provide compensation only for changes in laws
specifically related to EV charging infrastructure and associated services (by specifying, for instance,
that compensation would not be payable for the costs of changes in general laws on employment
or health & safety);
• treating a change in law that makes performance of the contract illegal or impossible as a force
majeure event (see Theme 10).
Any change-in-law protection for the private partner should exclude changes that were foreseeable at
the time it submitted a bid for the contract.
ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING CONCESSIONS: A CONTRACT GUIDE FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES3377
Theme 10
Relief, compensation and force majeure
A concession arrangement generally transfers the risk of design, installation, operation and maintenance
of the EV charging infrastructure to the private partner. However, the contract might recognise
exceptional situations where the private partner is entitled to claim relief and/or compensation from the
public authority. Contracts vary considerably in their approach to these exceptions. Some provide for
renegotiation on a “fair and reasonable” basis if exceptional or unforeseen circumstances arise, although
such “agreement to agree” arrangements create uncertainty and the potential for future disputes
between the parties.
Instead, it is good practice to have contractual mechanisms that clearly identify (i) the specific circumstances
that trigger relief and/or compensation and (ii) the procedure for claiming and quantifying the relief and/
or compensation to which the private partner is entitled. These types of mechanisms are common in PPP
contracts across a number of sectors and EU jurisdictions. This guide describes these mechanisms below as
“relief events,” “compensation events” and “force majeure events.”
Relief events
These might include the following events (provided they are not due to the private partner’s actions
or failures):
• accidental damage to the EV charging infrastructure;
• latent defects in any existing EV charging infrastructure for which the private partner is required to
take responsibility (if bidders did not receive adequate information during the procurement phase
that would have enabled assessment and acceptance of this risk);
• energy supplier failures;
• unforeseen site conditions (see Theme 2);
• delay in obtaining permits or authorisations, provided the private partner has complied with
relevant processes;
• delay by the grid operator, provided the private partner has complied with relevant processes.
The contract will typically state that if the private partner’s performance is adversely affected
by a relief event, the private partner must bear the financial consequences (such as a fall in user
revenues, deductions or penalties for poor performance) but can claim relief from the full contractual
consequences of the event (e.g. termination for default).
For example, if a fire (not caused by the private partner) damages a site and thus delays the completion
of installation, the private partner will bear the risk of revenues lost through this delay (although recovery
through insurance may be feasible), but its failure to have that site fully functioning by the contractual
deadline would not trigger early contract termination. Put simply, the public authority’s right to terminate
for private partner default would not extend to situations where the private partner’s failure is caused by
a relief event.
PART 2: STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF THE CONCESSION CONTRACT38
Compensation events
A public authority’s breach of contract (such as failure to provide access to sites) is typically treated as a
compensation event. Some or all of the relief events listed above might also be included as compensation
events. The decision to categorise each circumstance as a relief event and/or compensation event needs
to be made by the public authority on a project-specific basis. On the occurrence of a compensation
event, the private partner is entitled to relief from termination (as for a relief event) and to payment of
financial compensation from the public authority to cover its costs and losses. Under some contracts,
financial compensation might take the form of reduced concession fees and/or a contract extension,
rather than a direct payment from the public authority.
Force majeure events
An event is regarded as one of force majeure when outside either party’s control and, typically, not
covered by insurance. Some contracts recognise a broad definition of force majeure events (e.g. “an
unforeseeable event outside the control of either party”). However, including a specific list of force
majeure events in the contract gives certainty for both parties, which can positively affect the market’s
appetite for and approach to bidding. A contractual definition of force majeure events will often
include:
• war, riot, armed conflict, terrorism, or protests;
• nuclear explosions, or radioactive, chemical, or biological contamination;
• natural disasters such as earthquakes, landslides, lightning, floods, or storms;
• changes in law that prevent performance of the contract.
A force majeure event mechanism in the concession contract typically operates as follows:
• the private partner is relieved from the contractual consequences of non-performance (the public
authority cannot terminate the contract on grounds of private partner default);
• the private partner might receive some financial relief (for example, suspension of the obligation
to pay concession fees or of non-performance penalties), although this might depend on the
availability of insurance;
• if the event continues to prevent performance of the contract for a specified time period (e.g. one
month), either party has the right to terminate (see Theme 12).
In some jurisdictions, the impact of force majeure events is regulated by the law. Nevertheless, it can be
helpful to include specific provisions in the contract, even if their effect is only indicative and they do
not override the law.
ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING CONCESSIONS: A CONTRACT GUIDE FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES3399
Theme 11
Liability for claims
The contract will typically contain an indemnity from the private partner to cover any losses or liabilities
the public authority incurs as a result of the private partner’s performance or non-performance of the
contract. The categories of losses and claims covered by the private partner’s indemnity typically include:
• death or personal injury;
• loss or damage to property;
• breach of the public authority’s statutory duties;
• third-party claims brought against the public authority.
The contract might limit the private partner’s indemnity, for example by excluding claims that arise through
the public authority’s own breach or negligence, or by setting a financial cap (applied annually and/or for
the duration of the contract) on the private partner’s liability beyond that covered by insurance.
PART 2: STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF THE CONCESSION CONTRACT40
Theme 12
Early termination
The contract should set out the circumstances that may give rise to early termination, the procedure to
follow to terminate early, and the consequences of early termination. Although early contract termination
might be governed by the laws in force in the jurisdiction, express provisions in the contract give certainty
for both parties and can affect the market’s appetite for and approach to bidding.
Early termination can typically be triggered by the following:
• default by the private partner;
• default by the public authority;
• the public authority exercising its right to terminate at will;
• force majeure.
Private partner default is defined very broadly in some contracts (e.g. “material breach of the
contract”). Other contracts aim to provide greater clarity and certainty by listing more specific events
or circumstances. Another approach is to include in the contract a list of defaults and a catch-all
“material breach” default. The list of private partner defaults might include the following:
• insolvency or bankruptcy;
• failure to achieve certain milestones in the installation programme;
• failure to have appropriate insurance policies in place;
• fraudulent or corrupt behaviour;
• late payments (such as of concession fees owed to the public authority);
• repeated or consistent failure to meet certain performance standards, usually measured over a period
of time, and sometimes by reference to an amount of financial penalties accrued over a specified
period (see Theme 4).
Public authority default is, similarly, defined very broadly (as “material breach”, for example) and/or by
reference to a specific list of circumstances, which might include:
• a failure to provide site access that substantially prevents the private partner’s performance
of the contract;
• late payments (of capital subsidies that contribute to installation costs, for instance);
• breach of any exclusivity undertaking given to the private partner (see Theme 6).
ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING CONCESSIONS: A CONTRACT GUIDE FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES4411
In situations of private partner or public authority default, the contract typically provides that the non-
defaulting party may serve a termination notice on the defaulting party. The contract usually allows
a limited time period after receiving the notice for the defaulting party to remedy the default (if it is
capable of being remedied). Sometimes additional remedy periods are built into the definition of a
default: for example, a payment must be [x] days overdue or the installation programme must be more
than [y] months delayed before a party is considered to have defaulted.
The public authority might wish to reserve an explicit contractual right to terminate the contract at will
at any time. Overriding policy reasons might arise, for example, which would cause it to exercise this right.
The contract will also typically recognise the right for either party to terminate the contract in
circumstances where a force majeure event (see Theme 10) prevents one or both parties performing
obligations under the contract for a specified period of time (for instance, longer than one month).
Financial consequences of early termination
Many contracts recognise the need for a financial settlement between the parties on early termination.
This takes into account the circumstances of termination (who is at fault) and the fact that the
EV charging infrastructure will typically revert to public authority control. Some contracts leave
determination of this financial settlement to be agreed by the parties at the time (an “agreement
to agree”). However, it is helpful to set out some clear principles that will apply in determining an
appropriate settlement. These include, for example:
• the basis for valuing the EV charging infrastructure;
• recognising any funding contribution by the public authority to the purchase and installation costs;
• recognising loss of profit for the private partner if the contract is terminated for public authority
default or at will by the public authority;
• recognising any remediation or other costs the public authority might face if the contract is
terminated for private partner default;
• recognising any pre-existing claims the parties have against each other;
• recognising “shared loss” where early termination arises because of a force majeure event.
Any contractual provisions on financial settlement may, of course, be subject to the laws in force.
.
PART 2: STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF THE CONCESSION CONTRACT4422
Other consequences of early termination
The contract should clearly state what is expected to happen to the EV charging infrastructure on
early termination: in most cases, it will be handed over to the public authority. The contract typically
contains provisions to ensure a smooth handover, such as obligations on the private partner to:
• give the public authority all information, manuals, documentation and software relating to the
design, installation and operation of the EV charging infrastructure;
• leave all sites in an orderly state;
• transfer the benefit of third-party warranties and guarantees;
• transfer the benefit of any grid connection agreements.
ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING CONCESSIONS: A CONTRACT GUIDE FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES4433
Theme 13
Expiry
The contract typically takes one of two approaches to determining its expiry:
• fixed contract period: the expiry date is fixed by reference to the contract start date;
• fixed exploitation period: the expiry date is fixed by reference to the date when some or all of the EV
charging infrastructure becomes operational.
The first approach creates a stronger incentive on the private partner to complete the installation on
(or even before) time, as any delay in installing the EV charging infrastructure will reduce the time available
to generate user revenues. The second approach offers more flexibility to cope with unexpected events
during the installation period (such as unusual delays in getting approval for new charging stations), as the
period for the private partner to generate revenues is unaffected.
The contract should specify what will happen to the EV charging infrastructure on expiry, which will
depend on the length of the contract and the expected lifetime or use of the infrastructure after the
contract expires. If the public authority expects ongoing use of the infrastructure, the contract should
require the private partner to:
• leave the infrastructure in good working order (a particularly important provision if the public
authority has funded part of the infrastructure) and the sites in an orderly state;
• give the public authority all information, manuals, documents and software relating to the design,
installation and operation of the EV charging infrastructure;
• transfer the benefit of third-party warranties and guarantees;
• transfer the benefit of any grid connection agreements.
Conversely, if the public authority foresees no use of the EV charging infrastructure beyond the
contract’s expiry, the contract should require the private partner to remove the infrastructure and
reinstate the sites to their original (or other agreed) condition.
Some contracts allow the public authority to choose, just before the contract ends, between transfer
and removal of the infrastructure. The possibility of significant removal and reinstatement costs on
expiry will affect the market’s approach to bidding for and pricing the concession arrangement.
Therefore, unless removal is a realistic prospect, it may be optimal for the contract to provide for the
transfer of infrastructure to the public authority.

7Executive Summary
As battery electric vehicles (BEVs) continue to grow in number on European
roads, their integration into urban infrastructure—particularly in covered parking
facilities—has become a key focus for regulatory and safety considerations.
Recognizing this, the European Commission’s Sustainable Transport Forum
(STF) Task Force 6 has developed comprehensive guidelines aimed at
identifying and mitigating fire risks, as well as ensuring the safe installation of
recharging infrastructure in covered parking areas. This guidance, which provides
an overview of technical, organizational, structural, and preventive fire safety
measures, is intended for public authorities and other stakeholders involved in
fire safety in covered parking facilities. These include parking operators,
designers, risk assessors, fire service organizations, and original equipment
manufacturers (OEMs).
Despite initial concerns, existing studies show that BEVs do not present a higher
fire risk than internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). However, fires
involving lithium-ion batteries present unique challenges, such as thermal
runaway, jet fires, and vapor cloud explosions. Additionally, fire safety issues may
arise from the condition and reliability of recharging infrastructure.
The guidance outlines several fire safety strategies aimed at reducing fire risks in
covered parking facilities, which can be grouped into five key areas:
1. Prevention: Recommends fire risk assessments for both new and existing
parking facilities.
2. Detection: Suggests the installation of advanced fire detection systems
that can quickly identify fires involving BEVs.
3. Evacuation: Stresses the importance of designing clear evacuation routes
and placing recharging points away from emergency exits to facilitate
quick evacuations.
4. Propagation Control: Recommends using fire-resistant systems and
compartmentalization in parking structures to prevent the spread of fire
between vehicles.
5. Firefighting: Emphasizes the need for specialized firefighting equipment
and techniques tailored to the unique risks posed by BEV fires.
In conclusion, these guidelines provide a crucial roadmap for addressing fire
safety challenges in covered parking facilities where BEVs are present, while also
supporting EU decarbonization goals. Hence, the guidance aims to contribute to
a safer environment for the widespread adoption of BEVs.
81. Introduction
In recent years, the prevalence of electric vehicles (EVs) on European roads has
surged remarkably, with light battery electric vehicles (BEVs) such as cars and
vans leading this transformative trend. Globally, close to 14 million BEVs were
sold in 2023, capturing a notable 18% market share, and all signs point to this
momentum continuing strong.1
The European Commission’s Fit for 55 package represents an ambitious climate
agenda aiming to reduce road transport emissions to zero in the European Union
(EU) by 2050. In line with this objective, several key legislations have been
implemented or are in development to accelerate the widespread adoption of
zero-emission vehicles across the EU. One landmark initiative is the EU’s
mandate requiring all new vehicles sold to be zero-emission by 2035.
Additionally, the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) establishes
minimum standards for deploying recharging stations, including those in publicly
accessible covered parking areas such as shopping centres and public parking
lots. Further advancing this agenda, the recast Energy Performance of Buildings
Directive (EPBD) was adopted2 in May 2024.
The revised EPBD is strategically aligned with decarbonisation goals,
emphasising the critical role of the built environment in facilitating the transition
to zero-emission vehicles. The Directive focuses on expanding infrastructure to
support BEV adoption by promoting pre-cabling and the installation of recharging
points in residential and non-residential buildings throughout the EU. By
seamlessly integrating EV infrastructure into building design, the Directive aims
to improve charging convenience and accessibility, thereby fostering the
transition to cleaner transportation and significantly contributing to the EU’s
broader decarbonisation objectives.
As electromobility becomes increasingly prevalent, European lawmakers have
also recognised the need for harmonised fire safety measures in covered and
underground parking spaces. In response, the European Commission has been
asked in the revised EPBD for developing specific guidelines to address the fire
safety of BEVs in such settings.
The deployment of recharging infrastructure—encompassing both normal and
high-power recharging points in buildings and parking areas—is seen as vital for
enabling citizens to charge their vehicles conveniently. Normal power recharging
points, which make up the bulk of the infrastructure, provide consumers with
affordable charging options. Several countries have also embraced the ‘right-to-
plug’ principle, granting tenants the ability to install recharging points in garages
without undue interference from landlords or co-owners. This approach helps to

the Energy Performance of Buildings Recast, 2024)
9streamline access to recharging infrastructure, further supporting the adoption of
BEVs.
While the rapid growth of BEVs and recharging infrastructure raises concerns
about increased fire risks in covered parking areas, early studies suggest that
BEVs are actually less prone to fires compared to internal combustion engine
vehicles (ICEVs). Nevertheless, it is important for public authorities, parking
operators, insurers, firefighters, and citizens to address potential risks associated
with BEV deployment and the installation of recharging points. Factors such as
evolving vehicle sizes, new materials, and advancements in powertrain
technology demand continuous attention, especially as legislative frameworks
and building codes often lag behind these changes, particularly in existing
buildings and parking facilities.
1.1. Objectives and Scope
This document, prepared by the Sustainable Transport Forum (STF) under the
leadership of the European Commission and supported by a group of European
organisations, highlights key challenges and best practices related to the
deployment of BEVs in covered parking areas. It also provides a set of
recommendations for public authorities and private stakeholders to facilitate the
adoption of BEVs in covered parking lots.
The report has three main objectives:
● Identify existing and upcoming legislation relevant to the deployment of
BEVs and recharging infrastructure in covered parking areas.
● Examine challenges and existing practices concerning fire safety in
covered parking areas in relation to the deployment of electromobility.
● Provide recommendations for public authorities and private stakeholders
to enhance fire safety measures in covered parking areas.
This guidance document is designed to assist local public authorities in creating
a fire safety framework for BEVs in covered parking areas. It also serves as a
resource for parking lot operators, designers, risk assessors, original equipment
manufacturers (OEMs), and property owners involved in installing BEV
recharging stations in both new and existing covered parking facilities. The
overarching goal is to promote the safe and widespread integration of BEVs and
recharging infrastructure in these spaces.
10The guidance specifically focuses on category M13 BEVs intended for
passenger transport, such as cars and vans equipped with lithium-ion batteries,
which are currently the most prevalent type. It exclusively addresses existing
lithium-ion battery technologies available on the market today.
Within the broader context of electromobility, a key distinction is drawn between
BEVs and electric micromobility devices, such as e-scooters and e-bikes. BEVs—
comprising cars and vans—typically pose a lower fire safety risk compared to
micromobility vehicles. This is due to the advanced engineering of BEV batteries,
which are larger and more securely integrated into the vehicle structure.
This guidance focuses exclusively on BEVs, categorised under the United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) M1, to thoroughly analyse
and address the specific fire safety challenges associated with this group,
acknowledging their relatively lower risk profile compared to other electromobility
solutions.
1.2. Debunking Myths
The most common causes of fires in BEVs include constantly powered circuits
and higher current or amperage, which can lead to overheating of components
such as fuses, connectors, and wiring harnesses.4 Fire hazards associated with
lithium-ion traction batteries often involve potential short circuits due to loose
parts, faulty electrodes, corrosion, or flammable materials near the batteries.5
Because of the fundamental differences between ICEVs and BEVs, firefighting
strategies for BEV fires may differ from those for ICEV fires, particularly if the
battery becomes involved.
Numerous reports from scientists and fire safety organisations emphasise that
fires in BEVs are relatively uncommon6, occurring less frequently than in ICEVs,
which are reported to burn 20 times more often than BEVs, according to the
Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB)7. The BEV fleet is still relatively
young compared to that of ICEVs, so as BEVs age, there may be an increase in
fire incidents, particularly among vehicles owned by individuals who neglect
proper maintenance. In 2022, the MSB reported a total of 106 fires in various
types of electrified modes of transport in Sweden.8 Of these, 38 occurred in
electric scooters and 20 in electric bicycles, while 23 were in EVs—representing
just 0.004% of Sweden’s 611,000 BEVs.9 In contrast, 3,400 fires were reported

11in Sweden’s 4.4 million petrol and diesel cars during the same period, equating
to 0.08% of the fossil fuel vehicle fleet.10
Similarly, in Norway, data from the reporting system of the Norwegian Directorate
for Civil Protection (DSB) recorded 998 fires between 2016 and 2018, of which
109 were attributed to electrical equipment, and 65 originated in vehicles—only
two of these were in electric cars.11 In the Netherlands in 2023, there were nearly
half a million BEVs.12 That year, just 181 fire incidents involved all types of electric
vehicles (including BEVs, light-duty vehicles, and heavy-duty vehicles),
demonstrating the low frequency of BEV-related fires.13
Notably, fires in electric vehicles appear to be decreasing. According to the MSB,
the number of fires in electric cars has remained around 20 fires annually over
the past three years, even though the number of EVs has nearly doubled in that
time in Sweden.14 This decline is likely due to improvements in fire-suppression
designs in newer BEV models. Norway, which has the highest proportion of BEVs
globally, reported that EVs account for just 2.7% of vehicle fires despite making
up 17.3% of the passenger car fleet in 2020.15 Data suggest that EV fires are less
frequent than ICEV fires by a factor of 8 to 10.16 Most fires in electric
transportation devices (78.2%) involve scooters, kick-bikes, hoverboards, and
electric bicycles or motorbikes, rather than cars.17
BEV fires are not significantly larger, more intense, or more dangerous than those
in ICEVs.18 Research conducted by RISE through the LASH FIRE project, which
tested fire suppression systems on both ICEVs and EVs, concluded that EV fires
do not pose greater challenges for fire control than ICEV fires when adhering to
current international recommendations for drencher systems.19 While EV fires
share some similarities with ICEV fires, they also present unique risks that require
specific attention.
The spread of BEV fires to nearby vehicles is no faster than that of ICEV fires.
While lithium-ion batteries can produce jet flames that may spread fire, ICEVs
typically carry large amounts of liquid fuel.20 A leaking fuel tank can cause a pool
fire that spreads over several meters. Regarding the speed of fire propagation,
the polymer fuel tank of an ICEV will ignite more quickly than the lithium-ion

12battery of an EV when exposed to external heat.21 However, according to the
United States National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), extinguishing BEV
and hybrid vehicle fires often takes longer than conventional car fires.22
A common misconception about BEV fires is that they burn at extremely high
temperatures. In reality, the temperature of any fire depends on several factors,
including the type of fuel, atmospheric pressure, ambient temperature, and
oxygen levels. There is no evidence that BEV fires burn hotter than those in
ICEVs.
Although recent studies suggest that BEVs do not carry a significantly higher fire
risk than ICEVs, long-term statistical data remains limited. Insurers and
researchers need more comprehensive data to better assess and mitigate these
risks.

272.12. Slovakia
ATN_010 Safety aspects of electromobility - Garages in residential
and non-residential buildings with parking spaces with infrastructure
for electric cars
● Type: Guidelines on electromobility by the Ministry of the Interior of the
Slovak Republic, the Presidium of the Fire and Rescue Corps
● Scope of Application: National, focusing on fire safety in relation to
electric vehicle charging in garages.
Structural Fire Protection
● Fire Compartments: Utilises fire-resistant materials to segregate parking
areas, with varying degrees of fire resistance required depending on the
garage level.
● Design and Layout: Encourages a limited number of EV parking spaces
within a single fire compartment to mitigate risk.
Technical Fire Protection
● Fire Extinguishing Systems: For parking lifts or similar devices used for
EVs, the guidelines recommend the installation of a water-based fixed
extinguishing system or an equivalent fire suppression method. The water
supply intensity should be at least 14.7 l·min⁻¹·m⁻², as specified by the
President of the Fire and Rescue Corps directive no. 39/2003.
In collective and row garages, parking spaces and charging stations for
EVs are advised to be equipped with automatic extinguishing systems with
similar water supply requirements. Systems must be able to operate for a
minimum of 120 minutes.
● Smoke and Heat Extraction Systems: Garages are recommended to be
equipped with a system for the extraction of heat and combustion
products, using forced ventilation to ensure a minimum of 10 air
exchanges per hour. If natural cross-ventilation with at least 5% floor
coverage is not available, this mechanical system becomes essential.
● Fire Detection and Alarms: In garages with more than 20 parking spaces
for EVs and charging stations, the installation of an electric fire alarm
system is recommended, especially for smaller garages with fewer than
50 vehicles.
● Isolation Switches: Charging stations should be equipped with an
isolation switch to cut power in case of emergencies, preventing the risk
of electric shock for firefighters and other emergency responders.

ATN® 010 - Safety Aspects of Electromobility: Garages in Residential
and Non-Residential Buildings with Parking Spaces Equipped with
Infrastructure for Electric Vehicles
● Type: ATN® 010 is a non-binding technical standard offering guidelines
for the design, execution, and control of technical activities related to
electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure in garages. While non-binding, it serves
as a framework for voluntary compliance and can be adopted within
contracts or competition tenders.
● Scope: National guidelines focusing on fire safety for garages that provide
infrastructure for electric vehicle charging, applicable to both residential
and non-residential buildings.
Structural Fire Protection
● Fire Compartments: The guidelines recommend separating fire
compartments in parking areas using fire-resistant walls, doors, gates, or
free spaces. Fire resistance of structural elements varies based on the
garage level: 30 minutes for the top above-ground floors, 60 minutes for
the first underground and above-ground floors, and 120 minutes for the
second and lower underground floors. If fire compartments are equipped
with a fixed fire-extinguishing device, the fire resistance requirements can
be halved. These specifications aim to limit the spread of fire and protect
both the building and its occupants.
● Design and Layout: The guidelines encourage limiting the number of EV
parking spaces within a single fire compartment to mitigate risk. Proper
distances between parked vehicles and compartment walls are essential
to enhance fire safety.
29Technical Fire Protection
● Fire Extinguishing Systems: A sprinkler system is recommended for
underground parking levels with more than 50 spaces. The guidelines
suggest that fire-extinguishing systems be coordinated with firefighting
tactics to ensure protection against electric shock for responders.
● Smoke and Heat Extraction Systems: The use of Smoke and Heat
Ventilation Devices (SHZ) is recommended in garage fire compartments.
These systems must be designed following specific standards (STN EN
13501-4) to manage the anticipated amount of smoke and heat. In more
complex layouts, a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation is
advised to optimise ventilation system design.
● Fire Detection and Alarms: For garages with more than 25 parking
spaces, of which at least 2 are equipped with charging infrastructure, fire
detection and alarm systems are required. Automatic detectors should be
installed in underground parking sections.
● Isolation Switches: Each charging station should include an emergency
shutdown mechanism, allowing immediate disconnection in case of
malfunction or hazard. The shutdown should be accessible to both users
and emergency responders, with clear labelling.
Organisational Fire Protection
● Personnel Training: Technicians working on EV charging stations must
follow strict safety protocols, with only certified personnel authorised to
perform repairs or maintenance. Personal protective equipment (PPE)
must be worn, and all actions should be documented for compliance.
● Emergency Plans: Fire evacuation plans should be posted in every
garage. Additionally, in facilities with multiple fire devices, a fire response
scenario must be developed, ensuring that each device operates
effectively without disrupting others.
Preventive Fire Protection
● Max Number of Recharging Points: For new and renovated non-
residential buildings, one charging point is required for every five parking
spaces. This can present challenges for building electrical infrastructure,
especially in larger garages.
● Location of Recharging Points: Charging stations should be located as
close as possible to entrances or exits. Installing charging infrastructure
on the second or lower underground floors is not recommended due to the
difficulty of fire intervention.
● Inspection and Maintenance: Charging stations must undergo regular
preventive inspections. Inspections should include checks on electrical
wiring, functionality, and safety systems. Any corrective actions must be
documented, with retesting performed after repairs.

312.14. Switzerland
Guidelines on lithium-on batteries
● Type: Guidelines developed by Swiss association of insurers
● Scope of Application: National level, with clear specifications linked to
electric vehicles and recharging points.
Structural Fire Protection
● The Swiss guidelines include stringent requirements for fire-resistant
walls, doors, gates, and bulkheads to create effective fire compartments.
The code specifies detailed fire stability ratings for structures and fire-
resistance ratings for floors, walls, and escape routes. There are also clear
regulations for the surface area of fire compartments in underground and
above-ground car parks.
● In parking areas with one or more levels that are partially open, i.e. where
the surrounding walls have at least 25% non-closable openings, the
connected, non-compartmentalised surface area must not exceed 9,600
m2 per level.
● Separating fire compartments with fire-resistant walls, doors and
gates or fire dampers and bulkheads:
○ Construction concept for parking in low rise buildings up to the
height of 11m: REI30 for floor slabs forming fire compartment; EI30
for fire compartment walls and horizontal escape routes; REI30 for
vertical escape routes.
○ Construction concept for covered parking in mid-rise buildings
between 11m and 30m: REI60 for floor slabs forming fire
compartment; EI30 for fire compartment walls and horizontal
escape routes; REI60 for vertical escape routes.
○ Construction concept for covered parking in high buildings up to the
height of 100m: REI90 for floor slabs forming fire compartment;
EI60 for fire compartment walls and horizontal escape routes;
REI90 for vertical escape routes.
● Fire compartment: The fire compartment surface area of underground
car parks and closed above-ground car parks can reach 4,800 m2,
provided that they have only one level or that each level constitutes a
separate fire compartment. If the levels of multi-level car parks are in open
connection, the fire compartment area must not exceed 2,400 m2. In car
parks equipped with an extinguishing installation, the fire compartment
surfaces can be doubled. When exits from a parking with a fire
compartment surface area exceeding 1,200 m2 open into a vertical
32evacuation route, fire-resistant airlocks or vestibules must be constructed.
The fire resistance of the airlocks must be equal to that of the supporting
system, but at least EI 30. The doors of the airlocks leading to a vertical or
horizontal escape route must have a fire resistance E30 and be fitted with
automatic closing. Premises (with the exception of individual houses, small
buildings and annex buildings) with a surface area of up to 600 m2 housing
motor vehicles must form separate fire compartments.
Technical Fire Protection
● Fire Extinguishing Systems:
○ The code outlines the necessity of sprinkler installations in parking
lots and garages based on specific criteria related to the fire
compartment area and the building's structure. For parking in low
rise buildings up to the height of 11m and in underground levels,
walls and floors forming fire compartments must have the same fire
resistance as the fire compartments corresponding to the
assignment, but at least EI60. For parking in mid-rise buildings
between 11m and 30m, REI30 for Floor slabs forming fire
compartment; EI30 for fire compartment walls and horizontal
escape routes; REI60 for vertical escape routes; R30 for supporting
systems of the building. For parking in high buildings up to the
height of 100m, R60 for supporting systems of the building; REI60
for Floor slabs forming fire compartment; EI30 for Fire compartment
walls and horizontal escape routes; REI90 for vertical escape
routes.
○ A safety power supply is required for emergency lighting of
premises, escape routes and emergency signals, as well as for
powering fire protection equipment such as sprinkler pumps, fire
brigade elevators, firefighters and other important installations in
the event of fire. In the event of a failure of the normal power supply,
it must switch on in due time and for the prescribed operating time.
Portable fire extinguishers are only recommended. Parking lots and
garages for motor vehicles must be equipped with a sprinkler
installation: underground garages with one or more levels whose
fire compartment area per level is greater than 4,800 m2, as well as
those with several levels, with open connections, whose fire
compartment surface area is greater than 2,400 m2. Parking lots
and garages for motor vehicles must be equipped with a sprinkler
installation in closed above-ground garages with a fire compartment
surface area greater than 4,800 m2 and those partially open
(enclosing walls comprising at least 25 % of non-closable
openings), on one or more levels, whose fire compartment surface
area is greater than 9,600 m2 per level. Open connections are
allowed. A sprinkler installation is required in mechanised or
33automatic garages intended for compact parking of more than 50
vehicles. Sprinkler installations must protect annexes and covered
spaces serving as warehouses or housing motor vehicles, trailers,
containers, etc., when the fire compartmentation has insufficient fire
resistance compared to neighbouring uses. The sprinkler systems
must be located in separate fire compartments of the same fire
resistance as the fire compartment corresponding to the
assignment, but at least EI30. They must have safe and protected
access (e.g. from the outside or from a vertical evacuation route)
and be placed on the 1st floor, the ground floor or the 1st basement.
Doors must have El30 fire resistance. Access routes to sprinkler
systems must be signposted. An adequate access control system
must be provided, which does not obstruct the intervention of
firefighters. Any reaction from the sprinkler installation must
immediately trigger an internal and external alarm. The external
alarm must be transmitted directly to the official fire alarm centre.
● Smoke and Heat Extraction Systems: When the parking is underground
or closed on all sides, then smoke and heat extraction installations are
obliged for such parking areas larger than 600m2 and without
extinguishing installation (surface of the fire compartment or people), or b)
if larger than 3600m2 and with extinguishing installation (surface of fire
compartment or people). In the case that parking is above ground and not
covered by all sides, then smoke and heat extraction installations are
obliged for such parking areas larger than 2400m2 if without extinguishing
installation (surface of the fire compartment or people) and obliged if larger
than 4800m2 and with extinguishing installation (surface of fire
compartment or people). For above ground parking with 25% of its exterior
walls open, then smoke and heat extraction installations are not obliged.
Smoke and heat extraction installations should respect the following types
for the above-mentioned parking: smoke extraction by firefighters’ fans,
natural smoke and heat extraction facilities, mechanical smoke and heat
extraction installations. For parking lots, not only residential buildings,
smoke extraction openings positioned directly to the outside must be
provided in the upper part of the evacuation and rescue routes.
● Safety Lighting and Signs: Emergency signals in the parking must be
equipped with lighting and have safety lighting for escape routes and
escape routes inside the premises. In parkings, the direction of escape
must be indicated by markings when it is not immediately recognisable or
when the places are not familiar to the people who frequent them (for
example in vertical and horizontal evacuation routes, or in the event of a
change of management). Exits which are not immediately recognisable or
which are only used in an emergency must be signposted. The signage
must be easily recognisable and arranged so that at least one emergency
signal is visible from any point in the premises. The signage of evacuation
34routes and exits must be uniform within a building. Signs indicating escape
routes and exits must be placed at the height of the door lintel, transversely
to the direction of escape. Safety lamps powered by individual storage
batteries must be connected to the overcurrent protection device in the
same room. Emergency lighting must be checked according to the
manufacturer's instructions, but at least twice a year for the prescribed
operating time. An annual check is sufficient for safety lamps fitted with a
working status indicator.
● Isolation Switch for Power Supply: Emergency lighting must not be able
to be influenced by a main switch or by a switch for ordinary lighting in the
premises. Centralised emergency lighting power systems must be divided
into independent zones (groups). Malfunctions such as short circuits,
interruptions or short circuits to earth must not have effects on other
groups.
● Safety Power: A safety power supply is required for emergency lighting
of premises, escape routes and emergency signals, as well as for
powering fire protection equipment such as sprinkler pumps, fire brigade
elevators, firefighters and other important installations in the event of fire.
In the event of a failure of the normal power supply, it must switch on in
due time and for the prescribed operating time. Safety power elements,
such as overcurrent protection devices, switches, terminals and wiring,
must be separated from the normal power supply to the floors by a fire
resistance. Safety energy sources and the control panels relating to them
must be installed permanently, in premises with a low fire risk. The fire
resistance of these premises must correspond to that of the supporting
system of the building, structure or fire compartment; however, it must
achieve at least a fire resistance EI30. The doors must have a fire
resistance EI30. Safety energy sources must be separated by a fire
resistance EI60 from the distribution installations (connection devices and
control) of the normal power supply. The installation of storage batteries is
authorised in premises which do not present a fire danger. They must be
protected by an EI30 resistance box. Rooms housing storage batteries
requiring maintenance must be sufficiently ventilated in the ceiling area.
Suitable energy sources, independent of the normal power supply, must
be implemented for the safety power supply. The energy sources that can
be used for security purposes are the following: storage batteries such as
single, grouped or centralised batteries; generator sets consisting of an
alternator whose engine operates independently of the normal power
supply; an additional power line starting from the normal power supply,
provided that it is independent of it and that the two lines cannot fail
simultaneously. Powering escape route signs and emergency lighting via
additional lines from the normal power supply is not permitted. Safety
power supplies must be checked annually. Functional checks must be
carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's data by qualified
35persons who have received the necessary instructions. The state of
charge of the storage batteries must be checked annually and the
operation of the generator sets every month.

materials in the construction of EV parking areas to prevent the ignition
and spread of fire. It suggests materials with a minimum fire resistance
rating, aiming to contain fires within localised areas and prevent structural
collapse.
● Design Considerations: Emphasises the importance of car park layouts
that facilitate fire containment and egress during emergencies.
Recommendations include adequate spacing between parked EVs, the
use of physical barriers to protect EV charging points and ensuring that
EV charging areas are easily accessible for firefighting efforts.
Technical Fire Protection
● Fire Detection Systems: Advocates for the installation of comprehensive
fire detection systems that include smoke alarms and thermal imaging to
quickly identify fires within EV charging areas.
● Fire Suppression Systems: Suggests the integration of automatic fire
suppression systems, such as sprinklers, specifically designed to address
the unique challenges posed by EV fires. These systems should be
capable of activating in the early stages of a fire, providing critical response
time for evacuation and firefighting efforts.
● Emergency Power Cut-off: Stresses the need for easily accessible
emergency power cut-off mechanisms for EV charging stations to quickly
isolate electrical supply in the event of a fire, minimising the risk of
electrical fires spreading.
Organisational Fire Protection
● Emergency Response Planning: Requires the development of specific
emergency response plans for EV fires, including evacuation protocols
and the role of staff in emergency management. Training for staff on the
use of fire safety equipment and procedures for safely handling EV fires is
also emphasised.
● Information Sharing with Fire Services: Encourages the sharing of
detailed plans and information about the location and operation of EV
charging stations with local fire services to aid in emergency planning and
response.
Preventive Fire Protection
● Regular Inspections and Maintenance: Mandates regular inspections
and maintenance of EV charging stations to ensure they remain in good
working order and compliant with fire safety standards. This includes the
42inspection of electrical connections and the physical condition of charging
points.
● Risk Assessments: Recommends conducting detailed risk assessments
that consider the specific hazards associated with EV charging in covered
car parks. These assessments should inform the design, operation, and
emergency planning for car parks to ensure a comprehensive approach to
fire safety.
433. Key challenges related to fire safety of
BEVs in covered parking lots
In the rapidly evolving world of BEVs, fire safety in covered parking facilities has
become a critical concern. While fires pose risks in any context, the unique
characteristics of BEVs require a nuanced understanding of the potential
hazards. This chapter highlights the key challenges associated with fire safety in
covered parking lots for BEVs. By exploring these issues, it aims to provide
valuable insights for public authorities and private stakeholders to consider when
evaluating changes to guidelines, legislation, or safety practices. The discussion
underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to fire safety in light
of the growing adoption of BEVs, fostering a safer environment for both users
and emergency responders.
3.1. Fire safety challenges linked to the lithium-ion
BEVs
3.1.1. Types of potential dangerous phenomena
The current fire safety requirements for BEVs are inadequate to significantly
reduce the likelihood of hazardous events.27 Furthermore, lithium-ion batteries in
BEVs pose several risks, including thermal runaway, fires, jet fires, and vapor-
cloud explosion (VCE), along with the potential for reignition or delayed ignition.
The following sections in this chapter will outline and describe each of these risks.
It is worth noting, however, that while these risks associated with battery packs
exist, data from the Nederlands Instituut Publieke Veiligheid (NIPV) shows that
nearly half of electric vehicle fires do not involve the battery packs.28
Thermal runaway is one of the primary risks associated with lithium-ion batteries.
It occurs when a lithium-ion cell enters an uncontrollable, self-heating state
through an exothermic reaction. This phenomenon begins within the battery cells,
leading to their decomposition and potentially resulting in thermal propagation
within the battery pack. This process can continue with the release of gas and
smoke and may ultimately escalate to a fire.
A battery pack consists of numerous cells, each separated by a critical
component called the separator, which isolates the anode (-) from the cathode
(+). Thermal runaway can be triggered by a defect in a cell’s separator, often
caused by physical, thermal, or electrical abuse. Once initiated, thermal runaway
involves a rapid overheating event where elevated temperatures or excessive
27 (Troitzsch, 2022)
28 (NIPV Annual Report 2022, 2023)
44voltage initiate chemical reactions within the battery cell. If the battery’s cooling
system is overwhelmed, ignition can occur. This ignition can, in turn, heat
adjacent cells, leading to thermal propagation.
The more cells affected by thermal runaway within a battery pack, the greater the
likelihood of a fire spreading through successive cells. This chain reaction can
ultimately result in the failure of the entire battery pack.
Diagram of thermal runaway, Euralarm
Thermal runaway can sometimes begin at relatively low temperatures
(approximately 90–120°C), often as a result of overcharging. The temperature
rises rapidly as the failing battery releases flammable gases, which can ignite in
the presence of an ignition source or if the surrounding environment provides the
necessary conditions for combustion—namely sufficient oxygen generation, a
fuel source, and heat. A fully charged battery experiencing thermal runaway
generates a significant amount of heat and gas that may ignite when vented from
the battery cell. Short circuits can further contribute to ignition. However, if the
battery is discharged or has a low charge level, there may be insufficient energy
in the cell to heat the released gas to its ignition point, allowing the gas to vent
without igniting.29
Beyond mechanical damage or external thermal abuse, thermal runaway usually
occurs when the Battery Management System (BMS) fails to implement
countermeasures to address battery issues such as overheating. This can lead
to a range of reactions, including fires and explosions of released gases, with
potentially severe consequences in confined spaces. Several scenarios are
possible:
29 (Guidelines for Fire and Rescue Services: Risk Assessment and Handling of Fire in Lithium-
Ion Batteries, 2021)
45● Free-burning fire: Flammable gases ignite when exposed to an ignition
source, such as hot metallic particles inside the battery pack.
● Jet fire: Gases vent with momentum, producing directional flames, often
designed to escape from the side of a vehicle to reduce overpressure.
● Flash fire: Vented gases mix with air within their flammability range,
resulting in a deflagration (a rapid combustion event below the speed of
sound) that may quickly consume all available vapor without igniting other
materials.
● Vapor cloud explosion (VCE): A cloud of flammable gases forms and
explodes if ignited under conditions of sufficient confinement.
Additionally, various volatile components, such as benzene, toluene, and ethanol,
can be released during the thermal decomposition of materials like polystyrene,
ABS, and other resins, as seen in ICEV fires. Fire extinguishing water may also
become contaminated with harmful substances, including metals and halogens.
One significant risk associated with BEV fires is the potential for reignition after
the initial extinguishment. Reignition is dependent from residual stranded energy
and the internal pack temperature following the primary extinguishment. This
occurs when other cells within the battery pack, damaged during the initial event,
later enter thermal runaway. Such later reignitions have been observed during
real-world testing30 and pose challenges for firefighters in managing BEV fires
effectively.31 To address these challenges, some vehicle manufacturers are
developing new housing technologies that allow firefighters to directly access the
battery packs with fire suppressants, enhancing their ability to manage and
extinguish BEV fires safely.
3.1.2. Causes of battery fires
Batteries are more likely to catch fire when damaged. Four main categories of
factors can lead to fires as explained in the table below:
Cause of battery fire Explanation
Thermal abuse Thermal abuse in lithium-ion batteries occurs when external factors, like a nearby
fire, elevate temperatures. The first step is the decomposition of solid electrolyte
interphase (SEI) film and electrolyte occur at 80°C and 100°C respectively,
among which the chemical reactions between the negative electrode and the
electrolyte could occur as well.
30 Li-ion battery full scale thermal runaway test: environmental and personnel exposure influence
in case of rescue operations.
31 (Hynynen et al., 2023)
46Electrical abuse Electrical abuse happens when the current surpasses the maximum energy
storage limit, converting power into heat. If this heat is not dissipated fast, the
battery temperature rises, causing overheating and potentially leading to thermal
runaway. An over-current event like in short circuits generates excessive heat,
creating an electrically abusive situation that can lead to material decomposition.
Mechanical abuse Mechanical abuse happens when a battery undergoes physical damage, like
collisions or hitting obstacles. This can lead to various issues, with the most
common being a short-circuit. A short-circuit causes current to flow through the
conducting terminal, creating heat in the cell. If this heat is not dissipated quickly,
the battery cell can enter thermal runaway.
Flood damages Battery electric vehicles adhere to rigorous standards (UNECE Regulation n°100
- Revision 3, with amendments effective from 14 September 2017) to ensure
minimum protection against solid particles and water. However, damaged battery
packs, such as those from collisions, pose a risk, especially of saltwater entering
and potentially causing short-circuits between cells.
The speed at which thermal runaway propagates is intrinsically tied to the efficacy
of the chosen safety strategy and the materials used in the battery system.
Robust safety strategies at cell, module or pack level, including thermal
insulation, flame-retarding materials, and advanced cooling systems, significantly
slow down the propagation of thermal events. Additionally, State of Charge (SoC)
will play a big part on the thermal propagation.
3.2. Challenges and risks related to the recharging
infrastructure
Recharging infrastructure for BEVs involves several risks in the following
scenarios:
● Installations are not performed in compliance with applicable safety
regulations.
● The installer lacks proper qualifications for BEV charging installations.
● Electrical equipment used is unsuitable or unsafe.
● Maintenance or inspections are not conducted properly.
● Incidents of vandalism.
To better understand the challenges and risks associated with BEV recharging
infrastructure, it is essential to recognise that there are four distinct recharging
modes, each with its own fire risks. The table below provides a description of
these modes.

supply equipment to the BEV.
Note: This is a typical installation for “fast
charging”, “ultrafast charging”, “rapid
charging” and similar terms.
In addition to the elements listed in the table above, fire hazards related to BEV
recharging points can stem from short circuits, overloads, and over-currents. The
use of polymer flame-propagating materials in components like enclosures,
plugs, and sockets further contributes to this risk. However, these hazards can
be significantly mitigated by using non-flame-propagating products and installing
EV charging points in compliance with the relevant EN/HD and/or IEC
standards.32
32 (De Verschillende Technieken van Laden: Mode 1, 2, 3 En 4 | MobilityPlus (NL), 2018)
48Furthermore, charging Mode 2 may be utilised by an existing electrical
installation, where the vehicle is connected through a household socket via a
charging cable equipped with an In-Cable Control and Protection Device (IC-
CPD). During charging, a steady current flows over an extended period. The IC-
CPD limits the current, which may reach up to 20 A depending on the model.
Modern electrical installations typically design general-purpose socket circuits
with a maximum current of 16 A, ensuring that protections and conductors can
handle this safely. In installations adhering to wiring regulations, if the circuit
exceeds its design current, the overload protection device will activate to
safeguard the circuit. However, in non-compliant installations, protective devices
may fail to respond in time, and cables might suffer damage from prolonged
overloads. Supplying high currents over long durations in such installations poses
a serious fire risk. Although newer IC-CPD models (compliant with future EN IEC
62752 standards) include thermal monitoring to prevent overheating and manage
current flow, these safety features can be bypassed through the use of extension
cords, power boards, additional measurement devices, or travel adapters.
Another risk associated with recharging points is the lack of regular inspection
requirements for electrical installations, including recharging points, either at the
time of commissioning or as part of regular inspections.33 While some EU
Member States have specific requirements in this aspect, this is not a uniform
approach across the Union. The absence of inspections can lead to substandard
installations, particularly if recharging points are installed by unqualified
personnel, thereby increasing the risk of fire. With the growing demand for
recharging stations and a shortage of skilled workers, the pressure to deploy
installations rapidly is intensifying. This urgency can strain the workforce and
compromise the quality of installations. Proper training for installers is essential
to ensure compliance with safety and electrical standards. Recharging points
should only be installed by professionals with adequate qualifications, not by
individuals who have received minimal training through short courses or lack
official certifications. Reliance on underqualified workers increases the likelihood
of improper installation, posing risks to both the workers and the recharging
infrastructure.34
While the risk of fires during the installation of recharging stations is relatively low,
electrical safety risks for workers remain a concern. These risks, closely linked to
fire hazards, can arise from poor installation practices. In Europe, nearly 47% of
accidental residential fires are caused by electrical issues.35 Improperly installed
recharging stations, particularly those connected to building or grid electrical
systems by unqualified workers, heighten fire risks. Even after the initial
33 (Hynynen et al., 2023)
34 (McGlone, 2022)
35 (White Paper: Accidental Electrical Domestic Fires, 2021)
49installation, electrical safety concerns can emerge over time. These issues might
result from equipment wear and tear or user interference with the system. Such
risks are more pronounced when recharging points and their electrical
installations are not regularly inspected and maintained. 36 It is crucial that
operators of recharging stations conduct maintenance and inspections using fully
qualified personnel. Regular checks help mitigate risks associated with aging
equipment and ensure the long-term safety of the installation.
3.3. Challenges and risks related to human safety and
firefighters intervening on the scene
As with any type of vehicle fire in enclosed spaces, especially in residential
buildings, BEV fires can pose significant threats to human life, including the safety
of emergency responders on the scene. Fires can quickly spread between
vehicles—both ICEVs and BEVs—potentially trapping individuals in parking
areas with smoke or flames, leading to casualties. Vehicle fires, regardless of
whether they involve ICEVs or BEVs, release toxic gases and substances.
Even though BEV fires do not inherently carry an aggregated risk of toxic gas
emissions, fires, including those involving BEVs, produce various gases that can
irritate airways and cause corrosion, such as hydrogen chloride, sulphur dioxide,
and hydrogen fluoride (HF). HF is not exclusive to BEV fires; it is also released in
fires involving fluoride-containing products commonly found in ICEV fires and
household polymers. In fact, HF is present in almost all house fires, posing a
longstanding risk to fire services. Exposure to HF and hydrofluoric acid can occur
through inhalation or skin absorption. Inhaling fire smoke, including HF gas, can
cause severe lung damage and impair oxygen absorption.
Similarly, combustion gases from any vehicle fire are toxic and can lead to
incapacitation. Carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) are
common causes of death in fire incidents involving smoke inhalation.37 CO, in
particular, is the dominant toxicant in such scenarios as it forms whenever organic
materials burn. Halogen-containing materials, such as brominated flame
retardants, are more challenging to ignite and burn more slowly than non-
halogenated equivalents. This slower burning rate can result in a reduced release
of gaseous combustion products, especially if delayed ignition or rapid self-
extinguishment occurs.38
When responding to BEV fires, emergency personnel, especially firefighters,
must employ distinct strategies compared to ICEV fires, particularly if the BEV's
36 (White Paper: Accidental Electrical Domestic Fires, 2021)
37 (Eckstein & Maniscalco, 2006)
38 (Sergei Levchik et al., 2011, p. 240)
50battery pack enters thermal runaway. Despite differences, there are significant
design similarities between BEVs and ICEVs, which pose similar risks for
firefighters in enclosed parking areas due to the increased flammability and toxic
vapours released by modern vehicles with more combustible materials. In BEV
fires involving the battery pack, additional gases are released from the burning
electrolyte and lithium-ion salts. Studies, such as those by Lam et al., suggest
that while ICEV fires typically have a single peak heat release rate (HRR) followed
by a steady decline, BEV fires often exhibit two peaks: one when combustible
materials ignite and another when the battery becomes involved. Research by
Kang et al. further indicates that BEV fires may have slightly lower peak heat
release rates (pHRR) and total heat release than their ICEV counterparts.39 For
BEV fires, the primary heat contribution comes from the combustion of
conventional body materials rather than the battery pack itself. However, thermal
runaway in the battery can produce a jet fire, accelerating the spread to nearby
combustible components and the rest of the vehicle.
Firefighters must carefully evaluate each fire situation to choose the most
appropriate methods, tactics, and technologies, as strategies for addressing BEV
fires continue to evolve. To ensure safety during vehicle fire interventions,
firefighters may use towing equipment to move vehicles into open-air
environments, but this is only feasible if the vehicle is not in thermal runaway.
Such operations depend on factors like visibility, temperature conditions, and the
management of re-ignition risks. Additionally, the combination of lithium and
water can produce combustible hydrogen, further complicating firefighting efforts.
Maintaining a safe distance and wearing protective equipment, such as 1,000-
volt gloves, is critical near batteries and high-voltage circuits. Contact with live
cables carrying high DC voltages in EVs can result in fatal electrocution, with
injury severity depending on factors like current intensity, voltage, the conductive
path, and exposure duration. Even when a fire appears to be under control, risks
such as liquid splashes, spontaneous reignition, and explosions remain.
Reignition, often signalled by white smoke without a significant temperature
increase, can occur suddenly, while explosions can create dangerous missile
effects. Furthermore, upon arrival, firefighters may lack crucial information about
the vehicles involved or the presence of thermal runaway, making it harder to
formulate an effective attack strategy.
39 (Kang et al., 2023)
513.4. Challenges and risks for parking operators and
building owners
As BEVs become increasingly common on European roads, parking lot operators
and building owners must prioritise fire safety by providing essential services
such as parking facilities and recharging infrastructure for BEVs. A key concern
for these stakeholders is ensuring the safe parking of both BEVs and ICEVs,
particularly in enclosed spaces beneath or adjacent to buildings. This is vital to
ensuring public safety. Accommodating BEVs presents unique challenges for
parking operators and building owners, especially given the diversity in building
construction and design. Establishing consistent fire safety standards for both
new and existing structures is difficult, as some preventive measures are not
feasible in existing buildings. The increasing size of vehicles of both ICEVs and
BEVs further exacerbates the issue, reducing available space and increasing the
risk of fire spread and structural damage. Moreover, the use of proper recharging
infrastructure is critical. In the absence of designated recharging stations, BEV
drivers may resort to non-compliant equipment, which can significantly elevate
fire risks.40 Addressing these challenges, along with implementing necessary fire
prevention measures, places financial burden on operators and building owners
as they adapt to the evolving automotive landscape.
3.5. Challenges and risks for insurers
The mission of the insurance industry is to provide consumers and businesses
with protection against adverse events, such as a fire in a parking garage.
Consequently, improving the fire safety of BEVs in covered parking spaces is
highly relevant to the insurers. Furthermore, since the risks and losses from a
battery fire are not confined to the BEVs itself but can escalate, causing
significant property damage, loss of life, and serious injuries, insurers across
Europe are assessing how the growing electrification of mobility may impact their
ability to offer affordable risk protection. Although current data and research on
this evolving risk landscape remain limited, existing studies offer valuable insights
and direction for further action, particularly regarding BEVs in covered garages.
One such study, conducted by VdS Schadenverhütung and the German
Insurance Association examines the fire risks associated with BEVs parked in
enclosed medium- and large-sized garages. The findings emphasise that fire
risks are inherently higher in enclosed parking spaces, primarily due to the
release of extreme heat and smoke gases—regardless of whether the vehicle is
electric or powered by a traditional combustion engine. Additionally, there are
risks tied to recharging infrastructure for BEVs, the recharging process, and
40 (Hynynen et al., 2023)
52potentially defective or damaged vehicle battery systems. According to a study
by reinsurer Swiss Re41, fire safety risks may arise when multiple vehicles are
recharging simultaneously or queuing to use recharging facilities in confined
spaces, such as office parking garages, residential building lots, or
commercial/retail premises. Issues with recharging infrastructure can lead to
third-party property damage and liability claims, underscoring the need for
tailored risk prevention and management strategies.42
3.6. Risks for the environment
This final section addresses the environmental risks associated with fires
involving BEVs. BEVs possess unique characteristics due to their batteries and
associated components. However, it is important to emphasise that, aside from
the battery, the environmental impact of BEV fires is largely comparable to that
of ICEV fires. Both types of fires emit toxic fumes, contaminate firefighting water,
pollute rainwater and soil, and endanger surrounding plant and animal life. The
table below outlines the primary risks associated with BEV fires and specifies
whether these risks are unique to them or not.

fuels (such as petrol and diesel) are more
likely to initiate or contribute to the fire at
an early stage, for example, liquid pool
fires, than alternative fuels such as fires
of BEVs. Here, an offensive tactic could
be effective, but the personnel that fight

554. Existing practices to facilitate the
deployment of BEVs in covered parking lots
while maintaining high fire safety standards
Maintaining fire safety in covered parking lots is not simply a matter of selecting
specific measures and tools to install. Rather, it requires a combination of
strategies to ensure an adequate level of safety. This section explores best
practices for both preventing fires and managing them if they occur. It is important
to emphasise that the measures required will differ between buildings designed
for residential or public use and those intended solely for parking vehicles.
This chapter is structured around five key pillars, which represent the
fundamental aspects to consider when developing a fire safety strategy for
covered parking lots in relation with the safety of BEVs:
● Prevention of fires
● Detection of fires
● Evacuation
● Propagation control
● Fire extinguishing
In addition to these pillars, it is crucial for any building accommodating BEVs to
conduct its own risk assessment. Such an assessment should account for the
specific types of vehicles, the recharging infrastructure in place, and the materials
used within the parking area. Particular attention must be given to existing parking
facilities, which comprise the majority of current infrastructure compared to newly
constructed ones. Local and regional authorities are therefore strongly
encouraged to implement comprehensive fire risk assessments for existing
covered parking facilities as these assessments play a vital role in ensuring user
safety and minimising fire risks. By providing a detailed and objective analysis of
current infrastructure, these evaluations offer actionable recommendations for
improving safety. They also support the development of phased action plans
tailored to the constraints of individual operators, enabling a systematic and
effective approach to enhancing fire safety standards.
4.1. Prevention of fires
Preventing fires is a critical measure to reduce the risk of ignition. When
addressing fire prevention, three key aspects should be considered: access
56conditions to covered parking lots, the design of recharging infrastructure, and
the materials used in parking lot construction.
4.1.1. Access of BEVs in covered parking lots
As noted earlier, based on the existing research findings, BEV fires do not occur
more frequently than those involving ICEVs. Therefore, restricting BEV access to
covered parking facilities is neither practical nor beneficial. Such restrictions could
hinder the adoption of BEVs and contradicts with the environmental goals set by
the EU. For these reasons, it is advisable that BEVs are allowed to park in
covered parking areas. However, it is important to recognise that, like other
vehicles, damaged BEVs pose a fire risk. To minimise potential hazards, it is
advisable to prohibit damaged vehicles from parking in covered parking lots.
In the event of flooding, especially when saltwater is involved, BEVs should be
evacuated from covered parking areas and stored outdoors for a few days.
Owners and emergency responders should remain vigilant for signs of battery
fires, such as vapour clouds resembling smoke (either dark or light) and unusual
sounds like hissing or hooting.
4.1.1.1. Existing practice
The fire safety guideline in Luxembourg permits only BEVs with a European
Certificate of Conformity to be allowed to be recharged in covered parking lots.43
The European certificate of conformity confirms that the vehicle is authorised and
can therefore obtain a registration mark to legally circulate on public roads.
Building on this good practice, EU Member States can ensure that the current
condition of BEVs is well-maintained, allowing only vehicles that comply with
safety regulations to be present in covered parking lots. This approach helps
prevent damaged vehicles from occupying these spaces, thereby mitigating
potential risks.44
4.1.2. Deployment of recharging infrastructure in covered parking lots
In order to avoid any fire linked with the electrical risk coming from recharging
points, it is essential to address this risk and prevent fires related to electric
malfunction. In 2021, a survey analysing electrical risks of newly installed
charging point in residential buildings in France was conducted by CONSUEL,
which ensures compliance with the safety requirements imposed by the
regulations in force relating to electrical installations, by delivering the relevant
43 (L’Inspection du travail et des mines et le Service Incendie et Ambulance de la Ville de
Luxembourg, 2017)
44 (L’Inspection du travail et des mines et le Service Incendie et Ambulance de la Ville de
Luxembourg)
57Certificates of Conformity. The survey was performed from the analysis of 616
new installations, representing 28% of the installed recharging points that
year. From the survey, the main defaults observed in residential buildings are the
following:
● 14% Bad execution
● 9% Overcurrent
Less frequent (≤ 5%) issues have been observed on:
● Protective earth conductor (PE)
● Unsuitable charging point
● Earthing
● Inadequate sizing (cable section)
● Residual Current Device
● Cut off
● Protection against short circuit
Socket outlets according to national standards also cover all applicable safety
requirements, including requirements for protection against fire risk. Furthermore,
ensuring the safe deployment of recharging points necessitates a three-pronged
approach: assessing and maintaining electrical safety before, during, and after
installation. The European Association for Electromobility (AVERE) and the
European Electrical Domestic Safety (FEEDS) have collaborated to develop a
Safe Electrification checklist, outlining the procedures for the safe installation of
recharging points whose findings can be found below:
58Beyond the safe installation of recharging points, it is essential that regular
inspections are carried out. The following inspection practices are, according to
the FEEDS, deemed good practices:
591. Initial inspection and issuance of a certificate of conformity/inspection
report to be added to the technical documents related to the building in
order to ascertain correct selection and proper installation of electrical
equipment in accordance with national or local regulations.
2. Visual periodic inspection and maintenances actions at least every year
by the responsible of the building maintenance/occupant/user to:
a) Check for visible damage, wear, or signs of vandalism that may
have to be addressed
b) Examine charging cables for signs of wear, fraying, or damage.
Damaged cables should be replaced promptly to prevent safety
hazards and proper operation of the EV charger
2. A periodic inspection of the installation every 5 years by an approved third-
party professional. Depending on the context and local regulations,
periodic inspections may be required every year.
The benefits of following inspection practices are:
● Increased safety: regular inspections by qualified experts significantly
reduce the risk of fire due to faulty electrical installations.
● Regulatory compliance: Inspections ensure that installations comply with
applicable Standards and Regulations.
Beyond electrical issues alone, mechanical protections of the recharging stations
should be considered, like bumpers or steel bars.45 Furthermore, identification of
the exact location, type and status of the recharging points in a covered parking
lot through information technologies should also help operators of covered
parking lots and the emergency services about the nature of fire and how to
manage it.
When covered parking lots are equipped with Mode 3 recharging stations, they
should be equipped with an emergency power cut-off to isolate all charging
facilities in the event of a fire emergency. Based on existing practices, all charging
of Mode 3 or Mode 4 should respect the following:
● Emergency isolation points in suitable/practical locations.
● Isolated by “fire alarm’ trip from either smoke detectors, sprinkler system,
or both.
● Powered by non-essential service connection.
4.1.3. Standards
In Europe, harmonised product standards cover all safety requirements, including
requirements for protection against fire risk such as non-flame propagating

exhaustive list of examples of applicable product standards:
● EV supply stations according to EN IEC 61851-1:201946 together with the
relevant parts of EN IEC 61439 series and, where applicable, EN IEC
62208:2023.
● EV supply stations according to EN IEC 61851-23:2014 for DC charging
stations (mode 4).
● The standard of DC charging station (EN IEC 61851-23:2014.
● Plugs and socket outlets according to EN IEC 62196 series.
● In-cable control and protection device for mode 247 charging of electric
road vehicles (IC-CPD) according to EN 62752:2016 (under revision48) as
well as proposing Mode 3 and 4 as best practices.
● Conduit systems according to EN 61386 (all parts).

61537:2007.
● Cable ties according to EN 62275:2019.
● Cable cleats according to EN IEC 61914:2021.
4.1.3.1. Existing practices
From the survey conducted by CONSUEL and its findings, several key existing
practices emerge. It is imperative to enlist qualified installers for the installation
of recharging points and associated equipment, including protective devices and
wiring systems. Electrical safety hinges on skilled professionals, thus securing an
adequate number of fully qualified individuals capable of correctly installing
recharging points is paramount. It may be tempting to quickly train unemployed
workers to be able to meet the booming demand, but it is better to invest in and
value the traditional education system and seek to attract more students.
Furthermore, the installation of recharging infrastructure and their respective
devices must adhere to the prevailing standards in Europe and the specific
regions where the recharging points are being deployed.
In general, all recharging infrastructure must be safeguarded against mechanical
damage caused by vehicles. In order to do so, they could be positioned above
ground level on a raised platform or protected by curbs, bollards, or metal
barriers. Additionally, the use of extension cables for BEV recharging in public
areas should not be allowed.
46 EN IEC 61851—1:2019. Electric vehicle conductive charging system—part 1: general
requirements.
47 In some countries Mode 2 is not allowed in public areas.
48 IEC 62752 is under revision including new safety requirements for domestic socket-outlets as
the thermal monitoring inside the plug pins of the IC-CPD which stops the charging if the
temperature of the pins reaches 70°C.
614.1.4. OEMs
OEMs should anticipate the fires in the design of cars by developing a special
access to a battery pack to create an easy access for fire responders.
Manufacturers’ emergency response guides can provide sufficient vehicle-
specific information to firefighters for disconnecting an electric vehicle’s high-
voltage system.49 In order to mitigate the risks of stranded energy at the time of
emergency incidents, electric vehicle manufacturers should use the International
Organization for Standardization standard 17840 template to present emergency
response information.50 For an effective response from the firefighters at the time
of a fire incident, the manufacturers’ quick guide should include the following
information51:
● Fighting high-voltage lithium-ion battery fires;
● Mitigating thermal runaway and the risk of high-voltage lithium-ion battery
reignition;
● Mitigating the risks associated with stranded energy in high-voltage
lithium-ion batteries, both during the initial emergency response and
before moving a damaged electric vehicle from the scene; and
● Safely storing an electric vehicle that has a damaged high-voltage lithium-
ion battery.
The fire resistance test outlined in Annex 8E of UNECE Regulation No. 100 sets
technical requirements for the safety assessment of electric vehicles (EVs), which
should be conducted by the OEMs. The goal of this test is to evaluate the ability
of the Rechargeable Energy Storage System to withstand external fire exposure.
Meeting this requirement ensures that the driver and passengers have sufficient
time to safely exit the vehicle.52 OEMs can go beyond the minimum fire safety
requirements and flammability standards to better address challenges for
enclosures, plugs, and sockets used in BEV recharging infrastructure and for
electric powertrains and Li-ion batteries.
4.1.5. Fire safe materials
Fire-resistant construction materials should be used in the covered parking lots
to enhance fire safety while the garages should be kept free of all combustibles
and all general construction elements and must be sufficiently stable and
mechanically strong. The French Building code asks for the compartmentalisation
of walls by a fire-stop rating of one hour (REI60 if load-bearing, or EI60 if load-
49 (National Transportation Safety Board of the United States, 2020)
50 (National Transportation Safety Board of the United States)
51 (National Transportation Safety Board of the United States)
52 (Troitzsch, 2022)
62bearing).53 In the case of automated storage, the areas intended for vehicle
storage are intersected at least every 1,500 square meters by REI 60 vertical
walls. They are intersected horizontally at least every three levels by REI 60
floors. Doors in these walls must be flame-resistant E60C. For two-level car
parks, the structure is R60 and the intermediate floors are REI60. 54In other
cases, the structure is R90 and the floors are REI90. Partition walls with other
activities or buildings must be fireproof, from REI90 to REI 240 depending on the
activity and type of building.55 Communications between the parking lot and other
activities must be via a firewall with E30 doors.56
4.1.5.1. Existing practices
While all general construction components must be stable and robust enough to
withstand potential vehicle damage, recharging infrastructure demands additional
attention. The good practice from France57 suggests that the structures within the
right-of-way of the electric recharging station, and up to 8 meters beyond, must
have a minimum fire resistance rating of R 60, with the upper floor rated at REI
60. For two-level car parks, the structure should have an R 60 rating, and the
intermediate floors must be REI 60. In other cases, the structure must have an R
90 rating, with floors rated at REI 90. Communication pathways between the
parking lot and other activities should be protected by a firewall with E30 rated
doors. Moreover, the guidelines in the United Kingdom requires that the exterior
wall construction of the covered parking lots in certain types of buildings should
comply with statutory guidelines, with façade systems recommended to be
classified as Euro class A1 or A2.58 From the point of BEVs, the recent research
showed that the use of ceramifying silicone products in a single battery and
battery module interiors is an effective measure to prevent the thermal runaway
propagation because ceramifying silicone products acts as barriers and protects
up to 1200°C.59
4.2. Detection of fires
Implementing robust fire detection measures in parking lots, including detectors,
thermal cameras, and video surveillance systems, significantly enhances fire
safety. These measures enable early detection and identification of fires,
supporting swift evacuation, limiting fire spread, and aiding firefighters in locating
and extinguishing fires effectively. Fire detectors, strategically placed throughout

63the parking lot, promptly detect smoke, heat, or flames, initiating evacuation
protocols and intervention measures. Thermal cameras detect temperature
changes, identifying potential fire hotspots, while video surveillance systems
provide visual confirmation of fire incidents, aiding in verifying the presence and
location of fires quickly. Upon detection, automated alarm systems alert
occupants, facilitating safe and efficient evacuation. Early detection and response
help contain and suppress fire spread, mitigating damage and reducing the risk
of secondary fires. Real-time monitoring and surveillance capabilities provided by
video cameras enable firefighters to assess the situation remotely and plan their
response accordingly. Thermal imaging technology assists in pinpointing the fire
source and identifying potential hazards, helping in the development of effective
firefighting strategies.
In short, fire detection measures in parking lots are indispensable for enhancing
safety. By enabling early detection and response, these measures support
evacuation, limit fire spread, and provide crucial support to firefighters,
safeguarding lives and property.
4.2.1. Other Measures
In car parks, the presence of trained security agents can be invaluable in assisting
with evacuations during BEV fires and providing essential support to firefighters
at the scene. When properly trained, security agents become integral elements
in ensuring the safety of occupants and facilitating efficient emergency response
efforts. Furthermore, determining where EVs are parked helps the fire service in
gaining an initial understanding of the situation at the time of fires. Information
systems like e-call and license plate recognition can supply operators of covered
parking lots and emergency services with details about the BEV on fire, including
its type, status, and location. An overview of other measures for detecting fires is
as follows:
a) Early Detection and Response:
Security agents are sometimes present in car parks, allowing them to detect signs
of fire or smoke promptly. With proper training, security agents can initiate
immediate responses, including activating fire alarms, notifying emergency
services, and initiating evacuation procedures to ensure the safety of occupants.
b) Assisting with Evacuation:
Where trained security agents are present, they should be equipped to assist with
the orderly evacuation of occupants from the car park. They can provide clear
instructions, direct individuals to safe exit routes, and offer assistance to those
with mobility issues or other special needs, ensuring a swift and organised
evacuation process.
c) Implementing Safety Measures:
Security agents can take proactive measures to mitigate risks and contain the
spread of fire before firefighters arrive on the scene. This may involve deploying
fire extinguishers to suppress small fires, isolating affected areas, and
implementing crowd control measures to prevent panic and facilitate evacuation.
64d) Coordinating with Emergency Services:
Security agents should be trained to act as liaisons between occupants and
emergency services, providing critical information to firefighters upon their arrival.
They can convey details about the location and severity of the fire, identify
potential hazards or obstacles, and assist firefighters in accessing key areas of
the car park.
e) Crowd Management and Communication:
During emergencies, maintaining calm and orderly conduct among occupants is
essential for ensuring effective evacuation procedures. Security agents should
be trained to manage crowds, provide reassurance, and communicate important
updates or instructions to occupants, helping to minimise confusion and enhance
overall safety.
4.2.1.1. Existing practice
The recommendations from the United Kingdom point out that automatic fire
detection systems in covered parking lots, especially those with internal or
underground BEV recharging areas, are monitored either on-site or by an
accredited off-site alarm receiving centre.60 Specifically, as put forward by the
authorities in Spain, if the recharging infrastructure has a power output exceeding
22 kW given that operators should be able to choose to limit charge rates to below
this to circumvent additional requirements, the parking lots are equipped with a
temperature control system and smoke extraction. This accreditation is provided
by an independent third-party certification body.61 Furthermore, the
Luxembourgish regulation requires that the fire detection system must disconnect
the power supply to these charging stations when an alarm is triggered.62 A push
button that activates the parking lots general alarm and disconnects the power to
the recharging stations should be installed near the recharging stations.63 In
public parking, an emergency stop button for the recharging stations should be
located in the parking lot’s surveillance room.64
4.3. Evacuation

64 (l’Inspection du travail et des mines et le Service Incendie et Ambulance de la Ville de
Luxembourg)
65In covered car parks, the presence of various ventilation systems is paramount
for evacuating smoke in the event of a vehicle fire. These systems serve as a
critical element, providing essential time for individuals present in the parking lot
to safely evacuate and enabling firefighters to effectively intervene on the fire
scene. Different types of ventilation systems are utilised in covered car parks,
each with its unique capabilities and functionalities that are effective for the BEV
fires:
a) Natural Ventilation: Natural ventilation systems rely on passive airflow
through openings such as vents, windows, or shafts to remove smoke and
heat from the parking area. These systems leverage natural forces such
as wind and thermal buoyancy to facilitate the movement of air, helping to
dissipate smoke and maintain breathable conditions. These ventilation
systems are common worldwide. They are typically designed based on
some specific opening area, for example 35% in Poland, and 1/20 of floor
area in the United Kingdom. The experts involved in the project have not
found a scientific justification for those values. However, there is a long
history of such buildings and a general feeling that they are overall safe.
For small fires (approximately 1,4 MW) the open ventilation worked well in
86, 31% of cases. If the fires grew larger (4 MW or 6 MW), this percentage
drop down to 38,79% and 33,31%. In case of a fire representing the 95th
percentile of vehicle fires (8,80 MW), the open ventilation gave us
satisfactory outcomes for 14,24% of cases. 65
b) Mechanical Ventilation: Mechanical ventilation systems utilise fans or
blowers to actively circulate air within the parking lot, facilitating the
removal of smoke and pollutants. These systems can be configured with
ductwork and exhaust fans strategically positioned throughout the parking
area to ensure effective ventilation and smoke extraction.
c) Smoke Control Systems: Smoke control systems are specifically designed
to manage smoke in the event of a fire, typically incorporating both natural
and mechanical ventilation components. These systems may include
smoke detectors, smoke exhaust fans, and smoke barriers to contain and
disperse smoke, preventing its accumulation in critical areas and aiding in
the safe evacuation of occupants.
In the event of a BEV fire, prompt activation of ventilation systems is crucial.
These systems play a pivotal role in evacuating smoke from the covered car park,
creating clear pathways for occupants to exit safely and providing visibility for
emergency responders. By evacuating smoke and heat, ventilation systems buy
precious time for evacuation procedures to unfold smoothly. They also enable
firefighters to locate and address the fire swiftly, reducing the risk of further
escalation and facilitating more effective fire suppression efforts.
65 Research project OPUS19 No 2020/37/B/ST8/03839 “Wind effects on building fires in a
multiparametric risk assessment with numerical modelling” funded by the Poland National
Science Centre
66In addition to the evacuation of smoke and heat, it is essential that safety lighting
and signs are put in place in the covered parking lots to guide the evacuation of
the individuals and to enable firefighters to effectively intervene on fire. In this
regard, information adapted to the needs of occupants and users by means of
instructions, in sufficient number and in places should be ensured where they are
easy to read. This information signs should include guidance for responding to
fire emergencies. Through these instructions, individuals should also be capable
of recognising the alarm signal and understanding practical evacuation protocols
and routes.
4.3.1.1. Existing practices
Fire and smoke should not pose a threat to occupants or firefighters on the scene
at the time of a fire incident. Therefore, a smoke and ventilation system either
natural or mechanical should be available in the covered parking lots. As a good
practice, the French Building code requires that each level of parking lots, except
those with extensive ventilation, should be divided into compartments of less than
3,000 square meters, or up to 6,000 square meters if equipped with an automatic
sprinkler system.66 Next, sprinklers are effective at controlling fire development
within covered car parks, providing water-based fire suppression. When
automatic suppression systems are used with mechanical smoke clearance
systems, the sequence of operation for these systems must be carefully planned
to ensure that the mechanical ventilation system does not delay the activation of
the automatic suppression system.67
4.4. Propagation control
4.4.1. Space between vehicles and between vehicles and infrastructure
In enclosed car parks, maintaining fire safety for BEVs necessitates specific
considerations. According to reports from RISE68, key good practices to enhance
fire safety include:
● Increasing the distance between parked vehicles, achieved through wider
parking spots.
● Elevating the ceiling heights of parking garages.
In multi-level open car parks, the potential for fire to spread to another floor
through the drainage system exists, particularly in instances of liquid pool fires.
66 Building code: order of 25 June, 1980 completed by order of May 9, 2006
67 (ARUP, 2023)
68 (Hynynen et al., 2023)
67These fires can arise from ruptures in petrol or diesel tanks due to external
heating, and their extent depends on factors such as the amount of fuel, the
incline of the flooring, and adjacent drains. The probability of fire spread in
enclosed spaces is influenced by three primary factors:69
1. Distance between parked vehicles: Increasing vehicle width reduces the
distance between vehicles, thereby intensifying radiation. For instance,
widening parking spots from 1.6m to 2m decreases the distance between
vehicles from 0.9m to 0.5m, leading to a fourfold increase in radiation. The
width of parking spots, typically 2.5m, also affects the distance between
parked vehicles.
2. Materials used in vehicle manufacturing: The proportion of vehicle weight
contributed by polymer has risen significantly over the years, from 6% in
1970 to 18% in 2020.
3. Ceiling height of the enclosed space: Lower ceilings heighten the risk of
fire spread by increasing radiation from the ceiling towards vehicles, and
decrease evacuation times, as these times are based on smoke layering
remaining above occupant head level for a period of time.
4.4.1.1. Existing practices
As an existing practice, the Slovakian guidelines recommend having no more
than three adjacent parking spaces for EVs and charging stations, with the next
such group being apart from each other.70 Additionally, it is a good practice that
the recharging infrastructure is placed further away from escape routes.71
4.4.2. Structural fire protection measures to limit propagation
Separating fire compartments with fire-resistant walls, doors and gates or fire
dampers and bulkheads to separate BEVs from each other are essential for
limiting propagation as it helps with the fire protection of ICEVs.72 Separation
refers to the vehicle or group of vehicles, in its entire envelope, is located at a
distance equal to or greater than 3 meters (outdoors) or 4.5 meters (indoors) from
other vehicles or combustible elements, or is separated by E60 primary barriers
in the entire floor height, or a combination of both.73 Moreover, the covered
parking lots should ensure access to removal of BEVs in case of fire. To reduce
the chance of the battery reigniting, the BEV that caught fire may need to be

68moved outside the covered car park for monitoring and further extinguishing.74
Removing the vehicle is not the duty of the local fire and rescue service, so it
might be necessary to arrange a contract with a car removal company. If this
approach is chosen, the car park's clear headroom must be considered, as it
could restrict the types of recovery vehicles that can access the area.75
4.4.2.1. Existing practices
As an existing measure from the United Kingdom, recharging bays must be
separated by 120-minute fire-resistant concrete or brick walls, or a 60-minute fire
wall such as a twin-skin plasterboard wall. This fire separation could enclose
three sides of the vehicle bay.76 Furthermore, combustible or flammable
materials, such as storage or waste, must be kept away from BEV recharging
infrastructure and other vehicles.77 Emergency manual isolation of recharging
points must be provided to ensure the safe shutdown of equipment in the event
of a fault in the main electrical supply.78 These isolation points should be clearly
marked and strategically located for easy access by trained staff and firefighters.
4.4.3. Technical fire protection measures to limit propagation
Automatic fire protection systems play a crucial role in limiting the propagation of
BEV fires in covered parking lots. Sprinkler or mist systems are the main
technologies considered by the existing EU regulation and recommendations to
mitigates the potential impact of such fire incidents.
Sprinkler
Sprinkler systems in covered parking lots utilise heat-activated sprinkler heads
connected to pressurised water pipes. Upon detecting elevated temperatures, the
system releases water upon the heat source to suppress or extinguish fires. It is
widely used for fire protection in enclosed car parks and can often be supplied
directly from the water main. Sprinkler systems are also accepted by insurers as
a means to enable risk transfer.
Water mist
Another technical fire protection measure to limit propagation is the water mist.
Although it uses less water than a sprinkler system, it is usually more expensive
in this application than sprinklers because it always needs a dedicated pump and

76 (RSA, 2022)
77 (RSA)
78 (Fire Protection Association, 2023)
69tank. Water mist systems provide advanced fire suppression by dispersing fine
water droplets at high pressure around a detected heat sourced. These droplets
rapidly cool the fire, displace oxygen, and suppress flames efficiently. The system
can either be triggered by heat sensitive nozzles or other electronic detections
apparatus such as smoke, and temperature. It is a suitable alternative to sprinkler
systems, especially in existing garages where there may not be enough space
for a sprinkler tank as it involves less water and smaller pipe diameters.
Automatic systems’ impact on fire
● Rapid Fire Suppression: Sprinkler and mist systems are designed to detect
and respond to fires swiftly triggered by heat sensitive nozzles or other
electronic detections apparatus such as smoke, and temperature. These
systems will act to provide early warning to both occupants and alert
emergency responders to the incident. When activated, the system
releases water directly onto the fire source, helping to suppress flames
and prevent the fire from spreading further. The systems cannot extinguish
battery fires but could reduce or mitigate fire propagation.
● Cooling Effect: EV fires often involve high temperatures generated by the
vehicle's battery pack. Sprinklers and mist systems can provide a cooling
effect by dispersing water onto the heat source, reducing the heat source
surface temperature. Meanwhile, water droplets dispersion in the
atmosphere surrounding the heat source contains thermal radiation
around the car on fire. Hence, automatic extinguishing systems can
prevent fire spread from the first vehicle to others and reduce the overall
heat raise in the garage. A single car on fire, burning in a controlled manner
and without damage to the car park structure, is much more manageable
for the fire service.
● Protection of Surrounding Areas: Sprinkler or water mist systems are
typically installed throughout a building or facility, including in areas
adjacent to parking lots or garages. By suppressing fires at their early
stages, these systems help prevent fires in other areas from spreading to
vehicles, structures, or other combustible materials in the car park.
● Reducing Toxic Fumes: BEV fires can release toxic fumes and gases,
posing risks to occupants and emergency responders. By quickly
extinguishing the fire, automatic systems help mitigate the release of
harmful substances. Combined with the ability of water droplets dispersed
around the fire source area to capture water-soluble gases, they are
improving safety for both individuals within the vicinity and emergency
personnel.
Based on the limited number of existing studies, automatic extinguishing systems
are highly effective fire protection measures that can significantly reduce the
impact of all type of vehicle fires by swiftly suppressing flames, cooling heat
sources, and limiting the spread of fire and smoke. Their ability to operate
70automatically and provide continuous protection makes them invaluable assets
in safeguarding property and preserving life in the event of an emergency.
Some jurisdictions in Europe require sprinkler systems in enclosed parking
garages, whilst those that meet the code definition of ‘open’ traditionally have not
been required to be sprinklered.
● The newest 2023 edition of NFPA 88A, Standard for Parking Structures,
requires sprinklers in all parking structures, including open parking
garages.
● The 2021 version of the International Building Code (IBC) has also
included more stringent requirements that now require open parking
garages greater than 4.460 m2 to have a sprinkler system.
● EN 12845:2015+A1:2020 provide the minimum requirements for the
design and installation of automatic sprinkler systems.
● Fire hazards similar to “car parks” fall under the classification Ordinary
Hazard Group 2 (OH2). A wet-pipe or system should be designed for a
water discharge density of 5 mm/min. and an area of operation of 144
m2(dry-pipe system should be designed for 180 m2).
● NFPA 13 provides the minimum requirements for the design and
installation of automatic fire sprinkler systems.
● The European Fire Sprinkler Network (EFSN) position paper on sprinkler
systems in parking garages states that sprinkler systems can prevent fire
spread between vehicles, and that this also applies to BEVs. The design
hazard category should remain OH2 under EN 12845, in the absence of
evidence that this hazard classification does not provide adequate fire
protection.79
4.4.3.1. Existing practices
The Dutch fire safety guidelines recommend installation of a sprinkler or water
mist in covered parking lots where EVs are parked. 80 As a good practice for the
application of sprinklers, the Belgian Code of Good Practice points out that
sprinklers should be evaluated in light of the risk associated.81 These evaluations
should take into consideration of the size of the parking covered parking lot, the
amount of EVs expected to be parked, the amount of recharging points, whether
the parking is compartmented or not, and the type of building (whether residential
or not), and the number of floors in the building.82 Last but not least, it is good to
ensure that where automatic suppression systems are used in conjunction with
mechanical smoke clearance systems, the order of operation of these systems
79 (Hynynen et al., 2023)
80 (van der Graaf et al., 2023)
81 (Fireforum, 2023)
82 (Fireforum)
71are carefully considered such that the operation of the mechanical ventilation
system does not delay the operation of automatic suppression system.83
4.5. Fire extinguishing
4.5.1. Methods to intervene on fire
It is important that the emergency responders develop a strategy for the
firefighting immediately on arrival, whether offensive or defensive. According to
the “Guidelines for fire and rescue services” published by the Norwegian
Directorate for Civil Protection in 2021, there are 4 level of risks for fires in lithium-
ion batteries. The fires of BEVs in covered parking areas represent the level 3
and the medium to high risk. Extinguishing, containing and suppressing will
require appropriate expertise in the form of training in battery fires.
Another important aspect related to the fires of BEVs in terms of determining the
method of intervention is the risk of a hydrogen gas cloud explosion. In case of
battery thermal runaway, the total amount of vent gas formed can be estimated
from 0,6 to around 3,5 l/Ah. The gaseous hydrogen concentration in the gas
mixture could be around 25% of the overall gas released. In case of explosion of
the hydrogen content in a confined space, the peak blast wave overpressure
would end up between 14 – 20 kPa, at a distance of 20 – 50 m and it is function
of the distance from the cloud centre for various quantities of hydrogen mixed
with air. Liquid fuels such as petrol and diesel are more likely to initiate or
contribute to the fire at an early stage such as liquid pool fires than alternative
fuels.
On the issue of stranded energy and the possibility of reignition of a battery, if a
high-voltage battery is damaged, energy may remain inside any undamaged
battery modules and cells, with no path to discharge it. That stranded energy can
cause a high-voltage battery to reignite multiple times after firefighters extinguish
an electric vehicle fire. Emergency responders have no way of measuring how
much energy remains in a damaged battery, and no way of draining that energy,
other than such time-consuming methods as allowing a battery fire to burn itself
out. Engineers or other specialists can use the battery management system to
check for remaining voltage if the system is operational, and some batteries have
built-in discharge ports, also for use by specialists. However, the high-voltage
battery system can be damaged, preventing access to the battery management
system or to the discharge ports.84
The following methods (non-exhaustive) are used by firefighters currently:
83 (ARUP, 2023)
84 (Hynynen et al., 2023)
721. Using different kind of blankets for covering a fire source in order to avoid
the fire spread out to surrounding vehicles or infrastructure
2. Using water or other standard agents for electric vehicle fires. Water does
not pose an electrical hazard to firefighters in a BEV fire, but recharging
equipment does.
3. Using sprinkler systems help to prevent spreading fire by limiting its spread
and temperature, and by reducing the smoke and limiting the fire
development until the fire department can intervene. Moreover, if the fire
started somewhere other than the battery, the sprinkler system might even
extinguish it.
When handling BEV fires, firefighting personnel must always use full safety
clothing with respirators. For firefighting personnel, skin absorption will therefore
be the only way to be exposed to HF. When the gas mixture from a BEV fire is
below lower explosive limit, there will not be sufficient concentration of HF to
represent any significant risk to personnel. If personnel have control that the gas
mixture is below lower explosive limit, then the HF gases are also likely under
control. Normal firefighting clothing will in most cases offer good protection
against HF. In the event of extended exposure in spaces with poor ventilation, a
splash suit can be used as an extra barrier.85
International standards
Post Incident Vehicle Inspection is defined by the international standard SAE
J2990. It recommends two inspection stages after a crash or other incident to
make certain that the high-voltage system has shut down and is not damaged—
one at the incident scene and one at the storage site afterward. The vehicle
should remain physically isolated until it has passed inspection. Recommended
inspection steps, and what actions to take, are listed in the table below.
85 (Guidelines for Fire and Rescue Services: Risk Assessment and Handling of Fire in Lithium-
Ion Batteries, 2021)
73SAE J2990 recommends towing a damaged BEV on a flatbed, to avoid
generating voltage from the turning wheels. If the vehicle’s wheels must be
turned—because it has run off the road, for example—its speed should be kept
below 8km/h. After being loaded onto a tow truck, the vehicle’s structural integrity
should be checked. If the vehicle rolls while it is on the tow truck, the inspection
steps listed above should be repeated. SAE J2990 states that tow operators
should arrange to tow the vehicle to an offsite location where it can be isolated.
Once there, the vehicle should be inspected again. It should also be inspected
74for evidence of internal battery leaks, which could lead to short circuits or loss of
high-voltage isolation, and the battery should be examined for loss of mechanical
integrity. If airbags have been deployed, further diagnostic steps should be
conducted to assess the integrity of the high-voltage system, such as measuring
the battery temperature. SAE J2990 recommends two barrier methods for an
electric vehicle during storage:
● Separate the vehicle from combustibles and structures by 50 feet on all
sides, or
● Create a barrier of earth, steel, concrete, or solid masonry around the
vehicle.86
Concerning hazard communication, SAE recommends that manufacturers should
make emergency response guides available in digital format at any time,
accessible through links from a website, and that the information should be made
readily available to third parties.
ISO standard 17840 (Road Vehicles—Information for First and Second
Responders) is a set of two documents defining the structure and content of the
information that vehicle manufacturers provide for emergency responders to
vehicle fires or crashes. The Standard was created under the ISO/TC22/SC12
with the key contribution of the International Association of Fire and Rescue
Services (CTIF) with the collaboration of the European New Car Assessment
Programme (Euro NCAP). This standard provides with the rescue sheet, defines
the general content for manufacturers’ emergency response guides and defines
the labels and colours used to indicate the fuel or energy used to propel a
vehicle.87
86 (National Transportation Safety Board of the United States, 2020)
87 (National Transportation Safety Board of the United States)
75Euro NCAP announced in June 2020 that it had centralised the manufacturers’
rescue sheets in a free, downloadable mobile application for emergency
responders, called “Euro Rescue.” In its press release, Euro NCAP stated: “As
vehicles have become tougher, more complex and alternatively powered, it has
become increasingly crucial that first responders know what they can and can’t
do at the scene of an accident.” 88 This application supports the decision making
on energy identification, immobilisation / stabilisation of the vehicle, energy
isolation, instructions in the event of a vehicle fire, instructions in case of leaks
(gas, electrolyte), instruction in case of submersion, towing instructions,
emergency response guides, which should be aligned to the ISO17840 standard.
Responders to the fire are then much better positioned to be able to safety
interact with the vehicle and its systems.
Furthermore, the NFPA recently added to its website a training video for
firefighters, titled “Stranded Energy—How Little You Know Might Shock You.”89
A video prepared for the 2019 North American Heavy Rescue Symposium by the
NFPA, and others demonstrates best practices for responding to electric vehicle
fires.90
88 (CTIF, 2021)
89 NFPA Alternative Fuel Vehicle Training for the fire service.
90 The video demonstrates using a thermal imagery camera to check the temperature of the
battery and propping up a vehicle to apply water directly to the battery case. The video was
sponsored by the NFPA, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and the
training company Advanced Extrication, with the support of Tesla (accessed June 8, 2020).
764.5.1.1. Existing practices
BEVs are often equipped with emergency cut loops, low-voltage wire loops that
first responders can safely cut to disconnect the high-voltage system from the
rest of the vehicle. Severing the cut loops will isolate high-voltage power inside
the battery, thereby protecting the rest of the vehicle. However, cutting the loops
will not remove energy from the high-voltage battery. Manufacturers have
developed tools to drain the high-voltage batteries in their vehicles, but the tools,
which require a specialist to operate, are usually specific to the vehicle and work
only on an intact battery.
775. Recommendations for the private
stakeholders and public authorities
5.1. Industry and business stakeholders
● Emergency Planning: Businesses should implement comprehensive fire
emergency plans for all covered parking facilities.
● Signage: Recharging station areas in parking lots must feature visible and
appropriate signage.
● Staff Training and Emergency Response: Security personnel and other
staff should be informed about the location of recharging areas, power
isolation procedures, and alarm activation steps. Staff must be trained to
safely operate vehicle chargers and report damaged equipment promptly.
Defective chargers should be isolated, marked with warning notices, and
updated as ""offline"" in relevant apps.
● Fire Risk Management: Parking lots should not store combustible
materials or flammable products, refuel vehicles, smoke, or allow open
flames.
● Measures to consider at the installation phase of recharging
infrastructure:
o Location: Install recharging stations near the entrance or exit of
underground garages to facilitate quick access for emergency
responders.
o Qualified Installation: Only specialised, registered electricians should
install charging devices and associated power supplies to comply with
legal and technical standards. Non-compliant installations may void
insurance coverage.
o Protection and Safety:
▪ Protect charging stations from collisions or mechanical damage.
▪ Ensure compliance with these minimum standards:
- Power supply via a central distribution unit, with
overcurrent protection and residual current circuit
breakers for each charging point.
- Emergency shutdown buttons installed in secure,
accessible locations.
- Surge protection.
- Chargers mounted on non-combustible surfaces.
78- Clearly labelled kill switches and circuit breakers.
● Measures to consider for damage prevention
o Fire Alarms and Sprinklers: Install automatic fire alarms and sprinkler
or water mist systems to enhance safety, particularly given the
flammability of modern vehicle materials.
o Emergency Shutdowns: Equip parking facilities with automatic and
manual emergency shutdown systems for all chargers, operable from
a central location such as a fire alarm centre.
o Minimise Combustible Materials: Limit the use of flammable
materials or critical infrastructure near charging stations. Walls should
have adequate fire resistance (minimum two hours), and passive
barriers should be installed to contain fire.
o Risk Modelling: Recharging infrastructure manufacturers should
enhance risk modelling and battery performance monitoring to mitigate
potential hazards.
● Measures concerning standardisation and certification
o Infrastructure Standardisation: Increased standardisation can
improve accessibility and reliability of EV recharging infrastructure.
o Equipment Certification: Certification of recharging equipment
can enhance reliability and safety for public use.
5.2. Duty of care by the BEV user
● Users of BEVs have a responsibility as well, and they can play their part
by treating the devices and cables with care and by avoiding damage by
not crushing, shearing, or driving over cables.
● Users should consult user manual instructions regarding battery charging
(voltage, current, max charging times, etc.)
● Users should also frequently check the charging cables and charging
devices for damage, for instance by carrying out a visual inspection each
time before charging. Defective connectors and cables should be replaced
immediately.
● Only charging cables approved by the manufacturers and specifically
intended for charging electric vehicles may be used. Standard household
extension cables, multiple socket strips, or adapters for charging cannot
be used for recharging BEVs.
● Damaged, fire exposed, submerged or under recall electric vehicles or
vehicles in which the battery may be damaged could pose a particular fire
hazard and should therefore never be parked in any parking structure.
● Having a system in place that informs in case of overcharge on the electric
line connected to the wall-charger could help prevent fires.
795.3. Recommendations for public stakeholders
5.3.1. Firefighters
● During vehicle fire intervention, firefighters may use different kinds of
blankets for covering a fire source to mitigate the fire propagation.
● Firefighters may use towing equipment to move vehicles to open-air
environments monitoring the vehicle in case of thermal runaway. However,
potential high voltage batteries re-ignition cannot be excluded.
● Maintaining a safe distance, using 1000-volt gloves near batteries and high
voltage circuits, is crucial due to the potential exposure of live components
during physical damage and fires.
● Using water or other standard agents for BEV fires. However, a high
volume of water is one of the solutions to cool-down the high voltage
batteries. Water does not pose an electrical hazard to firefighters in an
electric vehicle fire. In a safe scenario and after a risk assessment,
transport a vehicle outside a parking area and eventually submerge it in a
big container (portable) with a water (cooling is the best way to control a
fire) if others extinguishing methods are not effective.
5.3.2. Public authorities
● It is recommended that local and regional authorities strongly encourage
fire risk assessments for existing infrastructure to ensure a high level of
safety for users and minimise the risk of fire.
● These assessments provide an in-depth, objective analysis of existing
facilities and offer recommendations for improving safety. They enable
progressive action plans to be drawn up, adapted to operators' constraints,
to raise safety levels in a structured and effective way.
● Public authorities can help in securing an adequate number of fully
qualified individuals capable of correctly installing charging points. They
can invest in training unemployed workers to be able to meet the booming
demand or invest in and value the traditional education system and seek
to attract more students.
● Public authorities should better regulate and enforce the fire safety
requirements for enclosures, plugs, and sockets used in BEV recharging
infrastructure by raising the minimum fire safety / flammability standards
as well as should introduce fire safety requirements and tests for
addressing new fire safety challenges for electric powertrains and Li-ion
batteries.
806. Conclusion
The rapid growth of BEVs in Europe, spurred by ambitious legislative frameworks
such as the Fit for 55 package and the revised EPBD, necessitates
comprehensive fire safety guidelines for covered parking areas. Despite existing
studies suggesting that BEVs are less prone to fires compared to ICEVs, there is
currently insufficient statistical information that enables the adequate assessment
of such risks, making the identification of effective measures to ensure fire safety
challenging. The increasing prevalence of BEVs and their associated recharging
infrastructure introduces new fire safety considerations that must be addressed
proactively.
Our analysis highlights several key points:
1. Legislative Support and Infrastructure Development: The Fit for 55
package, along with the AFIR and the revised EPBD, provides a
comprehensive legislative framework to support the deployment of BEVs
and recharging infrastructure. These regulations mandate significant
infrastructural enhancements, particularly in covered parking areas, to
facilitate the transition to zero-emission vehicles.
2. Fire Risk Profile of BEVs: Despite concerns, current data suggests that
BEVs, particularly those fitted with lithium-ion batteries, have a lower
propensity for fire incidents compared to internal combustion engine
vehicles. This lower risk profile is partly due to the sophisticated design
and engineering of BEV batteries.
3. Harmonised Fire Safety Measures: It was emphasised that harmonising
fire safety measures across covered and underground parking spaces in
the EU is crucial. Consistent guidelines will help mitigate potential risks
and enhance safety standards for BEVs in covered parking lots.
4. Challenges and existing practices to address them: Several challenges
and best practices have been identified in terms of fire prevention, fire
detection, evacuation, propagation control, and fire extinguishing. Best
practices addressed both national, regional, city policy makers for electric
vehicles and general recommendations for all types of vehicles; and
private stakeholders such as industry and business.
Several future considerations must be addressed to ensure the
continued safe deployment of EVs in covered parking areas:
1. Ongoing Risk Assessment and Adaptation: As BEV technology and
vehicle designs evolve, continuous monitoring and adaptation of fire safety
measures will be necessary.
2. Enhanced Training for Stakeholders: Comprehensive training
programmes for parking lot operators, firefighters, and risk assessors are
81essential. These programmes should focus on the specific fire risks
associated with BEVs and the best practices for managing these risks.
3. Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing: Increased collaboration between
public authorities, private sector stakeholders, and international bodies will
facilitate the sharing of knowledge and best practices. This collaboration
can drive the development of innovative solutions and harmonised safety
standards.
4. Integration of Advanced Technologies: The integration of advanced fire
detection and suppression technologies in covered parking areas can
significantly enhance safety. Research and investment in such
technologies should be prioritised to provide robust protection against
potential fire incidents.
5. Public Awareness and Education: Raising awareness among BEV users
about the importance of fire safety and proper charging practices is crucial.
Educational campaigns can help inform the public about the risks and the
steps they can take to mitigate them.
6. Policy and Regulatory Updates: Policymakers should remain proactive in
updating regulations to keep pace with technological advancements in
EVs and charging infrastructure. This proactive approach will ensure that
safety standards are consistently maintained at the highest level.
In conclusion, while the shift towards electromobility presents numerous
environmental benefits, it also brings new challenges such as a need for adapting
fire management practices in covered parking areas. By addressing these
challenges through comprehensive guidelines, continuous risk assessments, and
proactive collaboration and research, we can ensure a safe and sustainable
future for electromobility in Europe.

web,,"Alternative Fuels Data Center: Charging Electric Vehicles at Home Charging Electric Vehicles at Home Most drivers of electric vehicles (EVs)—which include all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)—charge their vehicles overnight at home using AC Level 1 or AC Level 2 charging equipment. Residential equipment is frequently installed in garages, but outdoor installation and use are also safe, even if the vehicle is being charged in the rain. Outdoor installations require outdoor-rated equipment. Charging at multifamily housing requires additional considerations and may be more like public charging than charging at a single-family home. Installing Charging Equipment in Your Home EV owners may install Level 2 (240 V) charging equipment in their homes for a faster charge, or opt for the Level 1 cordset provided with the vehicle as shown here. Many EV owners are able to meet their daily driving range requirements by charging overnight with Level 1 equipment, requiring no additional cost or installation, provided that a power outlet on a dedicated branch circuit is available near their parking location. Level 2 charging equipment can be installed for drivers with less regular schedules, longer commutes, or EVs with large batteries that require more than overnight (or the typical dwell time) to fully charge. State and utility incentives may be available to help offset the cost of charging equipment. Most Level 2 products have standard safety features and status lights. More advanced, ""smart"" Level 2 products have features such as data collection, user interface systems, enhanced displays, charging timers, communications capabilities, and keypads. Purchasing safety-certified equipment is recommended, such as the products certified under the ENERGY STAR label, which are tested by a nationally recognized testing laboratory, along with having a certified electrical contractor. Electricians can inform homeowners whether their home has adequate electrical capacity for vehicle charging. Some homes might have insufficient electric capacity for Level 2 equipment. However, a qualified electrician can add circuits to accommodate the capacity needed for Level 2 charging. The city of San Jose, California, was one of the first to issue requirements for installing vehicle charging systems in single-family homes and duplexes, and explains the permitting process and location planning for a home charging unit. In recent years, other cities have followed suit, such as Seattle’s tip sheets for both residential and commercial EV charging installations. Complying with Regulations Charging equipment installations must comply with local and state codes and regulations. Appropriate permits may be required from the local building and permitting authorities. EV charging infrastructure is considered a continuous load by the National Electrical Code (NEC). Your electrical contractor should understand and use the appropriate NEC for a safe and code-compliant installation. NEC Article 625 contains most of the information applicable to charging equipment. If possible, consult vehicle manufacturer guidance for information about the required charging equipment and learn the specifications before purchasing equipment or electrical services. In many areas, a site installation plan must be submitted to the permitting authority for approval before installation. Consider contacting your local building and permitting authorities for more information on identifying or complying with regulations. Electricity Costs for Charging The fuel efficiency of an EV may be measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) per 100 miles. To calculate the cost per mile of an EV, the cost of electricity (in dollars per kWh) and the efficiency of the vehicle (how much electricity is used to travel 100 miles) must be known. If electricity costs ¢10.7 per kWh and the vehicle consumes 27 kWh to travel 100 miles, the cost per mile is about $0.03. If electricity costs ¢10.7 per kilowatt-hour, charging an EV with a 200-mile range (assuming a fully depleted 54 kWh battery) will cost about $6 to reach a full charge. To compare the fueling costs of individual models of conventional and electric vehicles, see the Vehicle Cost Calculator. Note that actual residential electricity costs will depend on the type of equipment installed, as well as the time of day and length of time the charging station is used. Some utilities offer residential time-of-use rates or other rate incentives for charging infrastructure owners. To learn more about potential cost savings from enrolling in time-of-use rates, see the report: Levelized Cost of Charging Electric Vehicles in the United States. For EV charging, the stability and planning benefits of household electricity rates offer an attractive alternative compared to traditional types of transportation.

web,,"Alternative Fuels Data Center: Charging Electric Vehicles in Public Charging Electric Vehicles in Public General public charging uses Level 2 (shown here) or DC fast charging. For fleet drivers and consumers to charge their electric vehicles (EVs)—which include all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)—in public, charging stations must be deployed and integrated based on local community needs. Charging Stations Public charging stations make EVs more convenient. Although the majority of EV owners charge at home, public charging and workplace charging stations can increase the daily useful range of all-electric vehicles and reduce the amount of gasoline consumed by PHEVs. General public charging uses Level 2 or DC fast charging. Level 1 and 2 charging stations should typically be located where vehicle owners are highly concentrated and parked for long periods of time, such as shopping centers, airports, hotels, government offices, and other businesses. Public charging should also be located along highway corridors or at urban charging hubs. Learn about charging infrastructure development and operation and maintenance, and read a case study on public charging station procurement. For more information about infrastructure costs and charging infrastructure development, refer to Costs Associated With Non-Residential Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment and a review of charging infrastructure costs by the International Council on Clean Transportation. Fleet Charging Fleets that choose to incorporate EVs into their operations must consider several factors when planning for charging stations. Peak demand, duty cycles, garaging locations, vehicle models, and availability of off-site public charging stations can all factor into decisions about the number, location, and type(s) of charging units. City planners, fleet managers, and utilities can work together with installers to determine the best charging solutions. Fleets around the country are adopting EVs for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicle applications. Transit agencies, municipalities, and commercial fleets are also poised to make a significant transition to EVs. To prepare for and support this transition, several utilities have published fleet electrification guidance, such as Pacific Gas and Electric’s Take Charge: A Guidebook to Fleet Electrification and Infrastructure. Learn more about fleet electrification. Building Codes, Parking Ordinances, and Zoning Ordinances Building codes as well as parking and zoning ordinances are all regulatory tools at the disposal of state and local officials to further the EV readiness of communities. Each has a different potential role to play and can be used in tandem to encourage the adoption of vehicle charging infrastructure. Building Codes: Building codes ensure construction meets fire, electrical, plumbing, and other health and safety requirements. These codes are based on national or international standards, are adopted at the state or local level, and are enforced at the local level through permitting and inspection processes. Parking Ordinance: Parking ordinances are used to manage public enforcement of parking policies and apply to publicly accessible EV charging stations, including municipal lots, privately operated parking lots or garages, and on-street locations. Zoning Ordinance: Zoning ordinances regulate land use, including what can be built on a property.
